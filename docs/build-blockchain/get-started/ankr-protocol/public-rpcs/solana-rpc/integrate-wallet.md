# Integrate Wallet

Solana is not evm-compatible and therefore MetaMask cannot currently be configured to work with Solana.&#x20;

Solana does support several types of wallets via usage of the the [Solana native command-line app](https://docs.solana.com/cli) as well as wallets from third-parties.

For developers, [command-line wallets](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) are recommended as new features on the Solana blockchain are supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party solutions.

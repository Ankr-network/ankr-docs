Each BAS should have on-chain governance to let users vote for the new proposal on the chain. 
The governance is based on the compound’s alpha governance and validator owners in the chain are able to create new proposals and vote for them. 
Voting power is distributed based on the total delegated amount to the validator. 
Once ⅔ of the quorum is reached and >51% of votes are for the proposal, it can be executed by anyone on the chain. 
Governance is able to manage staking parameters, such as felony threshold or jail period.

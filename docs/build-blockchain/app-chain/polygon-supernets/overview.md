Polygon Supernets are a blockchain stack powered by Polygon Edge. You can also call it an ecosystem — a set of modules that work seamlessly together and add to each other's functionality.

They allow you to create a dedicated blockchain network optimized to fit your particular needs and easily deploy your Web3 applications on it without sacrificing security or performance. 

With in-built EVM support, Solidity contract are easily ported to Supernets without any modifications. So, any developers with Ethereum building experience can do the same on Supernets, using tools including Truffle suite, Hardhat, MetaMask, Remix, and block explorers with ease.

Supernets praise themselves for higher performance, constant and predictable throughput for multiple use cases, and customization through the configuration of every aspect of the blockchain network. Over 20 Web3 projects are using them.

# App Chains step-by-step
The entire process of customizing, launching, and testing your App Chain in chronological order.

The first thing you’ll do is launch a testnet so you can experiment with your network, test it, and determine which features and customizations you’ll eventually include in the final product.

## Step 1
First you’ll need to start with some validator nodes, which are essentially the basis of any Proof-of-Stake blockchain network. 
Five to seven validators is a good amount to start with.

Then you’ll need an RPC endpoint to interact with your network. 
The RPC endpoint is how devs can request data from and interact with your App Chain testnet. 
Without an RPC endpoint, developers won’t be able to remotely connect with the App Chain. 

Once you have validator nodes and an RPC endpoint, you can start tooling with your testnet.

## Step 2
Once the testnet is live, spend some time testing different configurations and customizing it to your needs — which may be unique for use cases like, for example, Web3 gaming. 
Need help finding what works best? Ankr can help you learn about and test different configurations.

At this point, a faucet that dispenses testnet tokens and a block explorer will be extremely helpful. 
These tools will enable you to test different functionalities ahead of a mainnet release, and keep a close eye on your App Chain testnet data in real time.

The staking UI should also be implemented alongside the block explorer. 
A staking interface enables your users to help secure your network by staking to validator nodes. 
The staking interface will require wallet addresses to function, so it’s best to build these tools simultaneously.

## Step 3
Once the dust has settled, it’s time to launch the mainnet of your App Chain. 
This is a crucial step, and Ankr is here to help you ensure everything goes smoothly.

Once your App Chain is live on mainnet, and you gain some traction and transaction volume, you can participate in Ankr’s Exchange-Readiness program, which helps you prepare to present your native token to CEXs in order to potentially have it listed for trading.

Keep in mind that as part of Ankr’s App Chain program, you’ll have hands-on engineering support throughout this whole process and for any and all issues that arise. [Contact Ankr to get started!](mailto:sales@ankr.com)

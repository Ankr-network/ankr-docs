# Using libraries

Developers can choose to interact directly with Ethereum clients via the JSON-RPC API, however there are often easier options for dApp developers depending on their language preferences.&#x20;

Polkadot clients have different libraries.&#x20;

Many API libraries exist to provide wrappers on top of the JSON-RPC API. With these libraries, developers can write one-line methods in the programming language of their choice to initialize JSON-RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with Ethereum.

### Examples of Ethereum libraries

The [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/) is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.

The [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. It was originally designed for use with [ethers.io](https://ethers.io) and has since expanded into a more general-purpose library.

The [Nethereum](http://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/) library is the .Net integration library for Ethereum, simplifying smart contract management and interaction with Ethereum nodes whether they are public, like [Geth ](https://geth.ethereum.org), [Parity](https://www.parity.io) or private, like [Quorum](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum) and [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).

### Examples of Polkadot libraries

Polkadot nodes can use libraries such as [@polkadot/api](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/), [go-substrate-rpc-client](https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot\_api\_dotnet), etc.

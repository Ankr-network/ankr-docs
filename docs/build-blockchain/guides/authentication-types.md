# Choosing an authentication type

## Basic authentication 
Requires supply of username and password in every request.

Suitable for simple needs only.

## Token authentication RECOMMENDED
Requires authentication token in every request.

Works by ensuring that each request is accompanied by a signed token which is verified for authenticity and only then responded to.

More secure.

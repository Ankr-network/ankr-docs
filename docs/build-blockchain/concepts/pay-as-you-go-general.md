# Use premium plan and pay as you go
To start using all the premium features, make a minimum deposit of 1000 ANKR tokens and create an Ankr Protocol premium account.

## General concept

We have created a system in which each request sent through an endpoint costs a certain number of units called credits.

One ANKR token you deposit gives you 1,000,000 credits.

If after depositing you decide that you do not need so many loans, then you can withdraw your tokens back at the same rate
:::danger Warning
The withdrawal function is under development and testing, it will be available to all users in the next release

:::
## Do you first deposit

Connect your wallet at [Protocol page](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/) page.

Visit your [Account details](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/account/) section in sidebar

Do a top up for desired amount of ANKR tokens

Our system will generate your personal endpoints
## Pricing

At the moment, our pricing is set several times lower than our competition. Use the full functionality of a geographically distributed load balancer for blockchain nodes for a fraction of the price.

Below you could find prices for blockchain that support standard EVM methods. For all other methods and blockchains price set to 100 credits.

# Access Ankr Protocol premium plan and pay-as-you-go
Introducing pay-as-you-go, a usage-based pricing that enables Ankr Protocol users to pay for each request they make to blockchain without having to overpay for any annual subscriptions. To get started with the premium features, all you have to do is make a minimum deposit of 1000 ANKR tokens and create Ankr Protocol's premium account.

## How does it work?
We have created a system in which each request sent through an endpoint will costs a certain number of units called "credits." Depositing one ANKR token will give you a credit score of 1,000,000. You can always interchange your credits with the ANKR token. For example, if after depositing you decide that you don't want this much of loan, you can always withdraw your tokens back at the same rate.

:::danger Warning
The withdrawal function is under development, it will be live in the next release.

## How to get started?

1. Connect your wallet to the [Ankr Protocol](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/) page
2. Explore the [Account Details](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/account/) section in sidebar
3. Top up the account with the desired amount of ANKR tokens
4. Wait for our system to generate personal endpoints for you

## Pricing

At Ankr, we are set to provide developers with pricing that is several times lower than what is being offered in the market - all while accessing a full functionality of geographically distributed load balancer for a fraction of the price.

Below you can find the price point for blockchains that support standard EVM methods. For all other methods and blockchains, the default price is set to 100 credits.

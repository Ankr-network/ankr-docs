# Hedera

Hedera is a public distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. 
You can use Hedera’s network services–Cryptocurrency, Consensus, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the [hashgraph consensus algorithm](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms), to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.

The network is made up of permissioned nodes run by the [Hedera Governing Council](https://hedera.com/council), a group of term-limited enterprises that lead the network's direction. 
Over time the network will [move to a permissionless model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTNNYeSks-s).

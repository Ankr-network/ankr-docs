# Nervos

The Nervos Network is an open source public blockchain ecosystem and collection of protocols**.**

The Nervos blockchain, also known as the Common Knowledge Base (CKB) is the layer 1 proof of work public blockchain protocol of the Nervos Network. It serves as a foundation to build on and provides trust to all layers built on top.

Decentralization whilst remaining minimal, flexible and secure is the core design principle. The main purpose is the reliable preservation of any data and assets stored within it.

# Rewards distribution

Reward distribution is determined by rewards received from the Ethereum 2.0 network.

* 85% is paid to the Stakers
* 15% is paid to the Providers

# How it works
Providers are chosen at random to create blocks and are responsible for checking and confirming blocks they don't create. Providers are rewarded for verifying blocks with staking rewards and platform fees.

Stake additional Ankr in your node to obtain a higher trust-level and have your pools prioritized as well as earning more rewards!
* 15% of Staking Rewards are paid to Providers
* 85% of Staking Rewards are paid to Stakers

The following example illustrates potential returns:

If you stake 2 ETH in your node, you receive: 85% of standard rewards + 15% of provider rewards for the other 30 ETH staked.

If ETH 2.0 staking rewards were an average of 10% for year 1 and ETH price was approximately $3000 (current price as of August 2021)

Your return would be:

Standard Rewards = 0.85 x 0.1 x 6000 = $1020 + 0.15 x 0.1 x 192000 = $2880.00

A total income of $3900 per year.

MINUS Option 1 - hardware costs, operational costs or MINUS Option 2 - $15.00 per month Ankr Node = PROFIT of $3700 pa.

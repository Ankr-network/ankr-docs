# Celo
An open cryptographic protocol that allows applications to make transactions with and run smart contracts in a secure and decentralized fashion. 
The Celo Blockchain code has shared ancestry with [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), and maintains full EVM compatibility for smart contracts. 
However it uses a [Byzantine Fault Tolerant](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) (BFT) consensus mechanism rather than Proof of Work, and has different block format, transaction format, client synchronization protocols, and gas payment and pricing mechanisms.

## JSON-RPC API
Celo is based on Ethereum implementation, so the API is similar to the Ethereum RPC API. 
Celo has a [ContractKit library](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit) designed to help developers and validators interact with the Celo-blockchain and easily integrate Celo Smart Contracts within their apps.

# Algorand

Algorand is an open-source, permissionless blockchain protocol and the first that utilizes Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS). PPoS does not require nodes to lock up their funds for a pre-defined amount of time like in other Proof-of-Stake systems.

It is a scalable, decentralized and secure layer 1 network that can power the next generation of financial products.

There are two types of nodes within the Algorand network
* Relay nodes: The primary use of relay nodes is communication routing to connected non-relay nodes. As a result, relay nodes require significantly more power to handle data flows to and from multiple connections
* Participation nodes: These nodes are connected to relay nodes and participate in Proof-of-Stake consensus.

## Node Types Available on Ankr

Algorand has two API versions to interact with the node and an Indexer API to query data about the account status and transactions.

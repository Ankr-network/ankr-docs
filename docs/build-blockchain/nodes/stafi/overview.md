Stafi is the first decentralized protocol unlocking liquidity of staked assets.
Stafi aims to solve the contradiction between Mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus. 
The token holders are staking through staking contracts built in Stafi protocol, and then get alternative tokens(rToken ,such as rXTZ, rAtom, rDot, etc.), rTokens are tradable and it can get staking rewards from original chain at the same time.

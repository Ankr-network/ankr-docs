# Bitcoin
Bitcoin is digital money that can be exchanged permisionlessly, peer-to-peer, without middlemen. 
It is based on open-source software anyone can run to keep the network decentralized and therefore censorship-resistant. 
Through the use of Proof-of-Work, the system ensures that a transaction can only be sent to one person at a time, preventing double-spending.

2. Search or scroll down to find the NewCypher card, hover over it, and press **Deploy**.

3. Now you are taken to the configuration page. The hardware configuration is already set at the optimal system requirements, but you are allowed to increase the specifications if you wish to do so.<br /><br />
   
   The platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is UK cluster, but another cluster may be recommended depending on your location.

4. The application name is pre-filled. You can change it if you want. 

5. Choose a network to deploy your node.
   
6. To actively participate in the NU Cypher network, the node needs an ETH wallet that should get funded regularly. We can generate one for you and will encrypt it with your desired password, or you can insert your own Keystore. Please make sure to write your password down and keep it in a safe spot, as you will not be able to use your wallet without it.
7. Select the Payment Method, choose the number of months you want to run the node by moving the slider. The price and discount will increase when you extend the run time.<br /><br />
   If later on, you want to extend the nodeâ€™s run time, you can add funds at any time
8. Click **Proceed to payment**.

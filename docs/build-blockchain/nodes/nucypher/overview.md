# NuCypher

NuCypher is a data encryption and protection layer for Ethereum (and eventually other networks) and [decentralized applications](https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps) (dApps) that does not rely on a central service provider. The protocol, which the team calls a decentralized key management system (KMS), aims to give developers the ability to store, share, and manage private data on public blockchains. Developers receive this encryption service via a network of NuCypher nodes in exchange for a fee (paid for in ETH). Participants can only spin up a node by staking NyCypher's token, NU, on the network as collateral.

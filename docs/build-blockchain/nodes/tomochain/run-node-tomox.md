3. Now you are taken to the configuration page. The hardware configuration is already set at the optimal system requirements, but you are allowed to increase the specifications if you wish to do so.<br /><br />
   
   The platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is UK cluster, but another cluster may be recommended depending on your location.
   ![Choose cluster](../../../../static/img/nodes/tomox-choose-cluster.png)
4. The application name is pre-filled. You can change it if you want.

5. Choose a name for your node.

6. For security reasons we advise to set up a new Tomochain wallet using [this guide](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/how-to-connect-to-tomochain-network/tomowallet). Insert the public address of TomoWallet into the Relayer Coinbase Address field from the Ankr App.

7. Select the Payment Method, choose the number of months you want to run the node by moving the slider. The price and discount will increase when you extend the run time.<br /><br />
   If later on, you want to extend the nodeâ€™s run time, you can add funds at any time
8. Click **Proceed to payment**.

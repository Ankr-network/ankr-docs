# IOST

IOST is a new generation of high-performance public blockchain focusing on performance and developer friendliness. Some great features include:
1. The V8 JavaScript engine is integrated inside the blockchain, so you can use JavaScript to write smart contracts!
2. The blockchain is highly scalable with thousands of TPS. Meanwhile it still has a more decentralized consensus than DPoS.
3. 0.5 second block, 0.5 minute finality.
4. Free transactions. You can stake coins to get gas.

The infrastructure is scalable and stable. After the launch of IOST mainnet in 2019, developers have made a lot of great DAPPs on the IOST smart contract platform.

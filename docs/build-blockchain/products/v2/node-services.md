 - There can be penalties if the uptime of your node is interrupted.

 - Internet outages can result in missed transactions and slashing events.

 - Managing node maintenance alongside ensuring constant uptime without loss of data. 

 - Risk of losing keys or damaging hardware that store keys.

 - Malicious attack.

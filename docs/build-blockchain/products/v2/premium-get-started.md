## Benefits

Enjoy the following benefits:

* At times of network congestion, Ankr Premium requests are prioritized.
* Establish a durable, low-latency connection via the websocket endpoint and have data pushed incrementally directly to you as soon as it is available. This makes it ideal for real-time data analytics

:::warning

The Websocket API limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections to provide protection against misuse e.g. DDoS attacks, for example. If your Websocket client makes too many connections at the same time, an error message will be received.

2.  Open your MetaMask wallet extension to authorize the connection.

3.  You are asked to provide your MetaMask public encryption key to enable Ankr to securely enable your deposit.

  :::info What is my Wallet Public Encryption Key?
  
  Wallets use cryptography to generate key pairs: a public and a private key. You can derive a public key   from a private key, but you cannot derive a private key from a public key. Your MetaMask Wallet address   beginning with Ox acts like a public key (although it is generated via an algorithm from your public key)  . However, this means that it is possible to share your wallet address or public key without anybody   reverse engineering it to derive your private key and gain access to your funds.

4.  Authorize your MetaMask extension to connect to Ankr Premium if you wish to continue.

### STEP TWO: Perform the deposit

1. Enter the amount you wish to deposit 10000 ANKR.

2. Confirm the transaction

  :::info Note
  **NOTE: There will be a small delay as the transaction is confirmed by 12 blocks on the Ethereum network.  **
  
  :::

3. Upon successful completion of the Deposit, the screen updates to notify you that you are now a Premium Member.

4. Ensure you securely disconnect by allowing access to your public encryption key again.

5. Finally, disconnect your MetaMask wallet by clicking ‘Decrypt’.

You can now access the **Private RPCs page** and all Premium Plan features.

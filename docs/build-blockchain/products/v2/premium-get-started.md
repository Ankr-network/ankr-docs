*Premium Tier* provides access to a range of exclusive features that allow you to build on a secure, reliable, ultra-fast multi-chain network. See more info on the Premium Tier's [pricing and charging model](/build-blockchain/concepts/pricing).


## Key features

1. Unique Advanced API endpoints providing specialist data. [Read more](/build-blockchain/products/v2/advanced-apis)  

2. Secure and private endpoints for HTTPS and WSS. [Read more](/build-blockchain/products/v2/premium-endpoints)

3. Hybrid Infrastructure. [Read more](/build-blockchain/products/v2/hybrid-infra)


## Benefits

Premium Tier is a set of *secure* and *private* RPC endpoints exclusive to you. They provide greater reliability by interfacing with a fully distributed, ultra low latency node pool. This node network infrastructure is distinct from the Public Tier infrastructure.

Enjoy the following benefits:

* At times of network congestion, Premium Tier requests are prioritized.
* Establish a durable, low-latency connection via the websocket endpoint and have data pushed incrementally directly to you as soon as it is available. This makes it ideal for real-time data analytics.

:::warning

The WebSocket API limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections to provide protection against misuse, such as DDoS attacks, for example. If your Websocket client makes too many connections at the same time, an error message will be received.

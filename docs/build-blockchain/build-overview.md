# Ankr Build

**Ankr Build** provides a truly distributed, multi-chain infrastructure network and toolkit to simplify the building of applications. Build Products include the following:

1. **Public Community RPC APIs** - Free and instant access to our range of Public Community RPC APIs. [read more](../build-blockchain/products/v2/public-rpc)

2. **Premium Plan** - Sign up to our Premium Plan with 10000 ANKR and get access to powerful features. [read more](../build-blockchain/products/v2/premium-plan)

3. **Ankr Scan** - Ankr Scan is a Multi-Chain Explorer allowing to view assets across chains as well as assigned to a specific wallet address. [read more](../build-blockchain/products/v2/scan)

4. **Node Services** Full, Archive and Validator/Staking nodes are available for 50+ chains. 

## Are you serious about decentralization?

Ankr provides truly distributed and decentralized Web3 infrastructure to run node services. If you care about security and reliability, the optimum Web3 Infrastructure is both Distributed AND Decentralized.

As an industry and a community, back door centralization through the use of large cloud providers is a dominant model in node infrastructure provision. This sits counter to the vision of true decentralization and reintroduces a central point of failure. 

The Ankr model is different. 

## Web3 Infrastructure and back door centralization 

The key premise of Web3 is decentralization. 

Decentralization is the central ethos of blockchain technology and drives projects across the ecosystem.
However, the vast majority of node infrastructure is relying heavily on Cloud Service Providers such as Google or AWS. This includes most Node as a Service providers such as Alchemy and Infura.

Cloud service providers have data storage facilities around the globe and have greater uptime and easier access, but crucially - control access is centralized. The biggest concern with centralized data storage models is that users are required to place trust in the central authority of the provider.

Cloud service providers can experience service outages, be compelled by Governments to hand over data, they may also provide a target for nation-states or attackers looking to disrupt the network. 

## Ankr is fully Distributed and moving towards full decentralization with community-run nodes 

Ankr is probably the most **distributed** web3 infrastructure company in the world. Without any dependency on centralized cloud providers, Ankr nodes are geographically distributed across independent data centres around the globe. 

We are gradually making it easier for the community to add their own node(s) to the Ankr Network as well as enabling other node service providers and enterprises to contribute their node infrastructure to the network and benefit from rewards. This is part of the shift towards a DAO based **Ankr Protocol** and fully **decentralized** web3 infrastructure provision.


## What is the difference between Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Web3 infrastructure?
Web3 Infrastructures are composed of a network of nodes that can be centralized, decentralized or distributed.

A network is a set of nodes and a set of edges, or interconnections between nodes. This means that it is possible to have a network that is made up of several islands of nodes, where no connections exist between nodes on different islands. These islands are called **Components**.

In general, there are three primary network architectures: **Centralized**, **Distributed** and **Decentralized**.

### Centralized network
In a Centralized network, there is a central network owner connecting all the other users and devices. This creates a single point of failure. For example, private blockchains run on servers controlled by a single organization. The central authority determines who can run a node. 

### Decentralized network
Decentralized networks are built from a hierarchy of nodes. There is no central network owner and control is spread across independent entities. However, if you look at the diagram above, you can see that nodes at the bottom of the hierarchy have only a single connection to the network. This means that failure of a few nodes in a decentralized network leaves several connected components of nodes able to communicate with each other (but not with nodes in a different component or island).  

:::tip Key point
Centralized and Decentralized networks are concerned with control of the network.

### Distributed network
Though often used as synonyms, **Decentralized** and **Distributed** networks are not the same. 

A Distributed network refers to the physical distribution of nodes. 

Every node has roughly the same number of edges or interconnections, and there are multiple routes in which nodes can connect with each other. 

A non-distributed system resides in a single location, whereas a distributed system resides in multiple physical locations. 

Networks that are more distributed tend to be more resilient to the failure of individual nodes or loss of connection between them. 

:::tip Key point
A Distributed network is about the Physical distribution of nodes. Control is a separate concern. Therefore, a Distributed network can be either Centralized or Decentralized.

## Overview

Ankr RPC Services is the gateway through which Web3 developers, projects, and protocols connect to the node infrastructure and development tools they need to build Web3 applications.

The evolution of Ankr Network includes our free, public RPC endpoints that developers have come to know and love, alongside new Premium and Enterprise plans packed with advanced developer tools â€” all powered by a globally distributed and decentralized network of nodes. In the new Ankr Network, developers pay-as-they-go for access to on-chain data, independent node providers serve blockchain requests to earn ANKR tokens, and stakers contribute ANKR tokens to full nodes to secure the network and share in the rewards.

Public RPCs are available to all and free to use on the Ankr RPC platform. Today, blockchain developers and projects can use these RPC endpoints to access Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Solana, Celo, Near, Fantom, Ethereum, and many other blockchain networks with no need to input user info or login credentials. Simply visit our [RPC Services](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) to start using these endpoints.
 
To access all the advanced features of Ankr RPC, developers can use Premium services with a flexible and affordable pay-as-you-go model denominated in ANKR tokens. Premium features include exclusive multi-chain RPC endpoints, prioritized requests, WebSockets, and Advanced Developer APIs that are designed to make Web3 development an easy task.

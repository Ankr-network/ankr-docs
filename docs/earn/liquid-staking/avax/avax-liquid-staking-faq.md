### Are there any docs about the AVAX staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

Yes — there is a [user guide](https://www.ankr.com/docs/Earn/liquid-staking/avax/stake-avax).


### What is the minimum amount of AVAX I can stake?

No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited.  


### What is the unbonding period for aAVAXb?

You receive the unstaked amount after the end of the current validating period. A validating period is 4 weeks.


### How do I receive rewards? 

aAVAXb is a rebasing token. When holding aAVAXb, your balance will increase in proportion to your AVAX staking rewards. 
A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. 
So each day, you will see the quantity of your aAVAXb increase by a small amount. 


### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

aAVAXb will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. 


### Does Ankr charge for the service?

2% commission on the reward. 


### What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aAVAXb?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to.
Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.
 

### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. 
Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction, attacks the network, or goes offline. 
The delegated staked AVAX is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. 
Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

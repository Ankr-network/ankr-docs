# Avalanche Liquid Staking

Ankr Earn offers Avalanche token holders the opportunity to stake AVAX and in return claim Ankr Avalanche Liquid Staking tokens (aAVAXb).

aAVAXb, similarly to aETHb, is a reward earning token, meaning that rewards from Avalanche staking will be distributed daily through rebasing. In other words, the balance of aAVAXb tokens will increase daily in every holderâ€™s wallet.

Contrary to ETH staking, it is also possible to unstake AVAX tokens. Therefore, aAVAXb will benefit from the following aAVAXb liquidity options:

### 1. Market liquidity

aAVAXb is tradable on the following Decentralized Exchanges on Avalanche network:

* [**Pangolin**](https://pangolin.exchange)
* [**Lydia Finance**](https://www.lydia.finance)

### 2. Unstaking

From the Ankr Earn dashboard, you can choose to **Unstake** and redeem aAVAXb. 
Wait for up to 28 days to redeem 1 aAVAXb for 1 AVAX. 

:::info
Unstaking means that aAVAXb has an **elastic supply** contributing to a **robust price stability mechanism** without relying on having large amounts of tokens in liquidity pools to ensure token price stability.

### 3. Access **Instant Liquidity Pools** 

* Ankr token holders can soon gain access to instant liquidity pools. This allows them to sell 1 aAVAXb against 1 AVAX instantly and subject to the instant liquidity pool capacity. 

* 3% of the allocated AVAX tokens to Ankr Earn will not be staked and will remain unstaked.

* aAVAXb holders indirectly bear the cost of the instant liquidity pool, which will represent 3% of the staking rewards due to the missed opportunity to stake AVAX. Therefore, the total cost for aAVAXb holders will be 2% service fee, plus 3% missed opportunity to stake AVAX, which equals 4.94% (no service fee applied to 3% instant liquidity pool).

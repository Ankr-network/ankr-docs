A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs.

aFTMb will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. 


### Does Ankr charge for the service?

When unstaking, users pay a burn fee that depends on the current liquidity and amount to unstake.


### What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aFTMb?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to.
Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.
 

### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

If a validator node acts maliciously, delegators will also be slashed as this is an essential part of the Fantom network’s security.  
Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

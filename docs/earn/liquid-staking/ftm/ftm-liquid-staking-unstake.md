Unstaknig also applies an unstake fee that depends on the current liquidity and amount to unstake. The fee is deducted from the unstaked amount.

Unstaking FTM tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the FTM smart-contracts deployed in Binance chain and Binance Smart Chain.

# Polygon Liquid Staking

**Polygon Liquid Staking** from Ankr Earn offers instant liquidity for your staked MATIC, enabling you to connect your tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

Polygon Liquid Staking enables you to earn **alpha**. (Alpha is a return on investment that goes far beyond normal increases in the crypto market index). Ankr Earn can connect you to the best ways to earn more crypto by staking, arbitrage trading, yield farming, and much more.

## Benefits

* **Generate Multiple Layers of Rewards**: Use the aMATICb bond token on DeFi platforms like OnX. These platforms enable you to multiply your earning potential in APY on top of your staking rewards!

* **Low Impermanent Loss**: Contributing aMATICb tokens for liquidity with tokens like MATIC means low risk of impermanent loss, expanding the upside of providing liquidity for a more stable and profitable experience.

* **Compound Your Staking Rewards**: Your staking rewards will compound every two months as your wallet’s aMATICb balance increases.

* **Ethereum market opportunities**: Since aMATICb is an ERC-20 token staked via Ethereum, you will be able to access a variety of DEXs to instantly buy or sell aMATICb.

* **Support & Secure Polygon**: Staking MATIC directly supports the Polygon network and helps validate transactions. Ankr’s staking system distributes staked tokens intelligently across the Polygon ecosystem to achieve optimal decentralization.

* **Elastic Supply**: Users will be able to trade in their aMATICb tokens for their staked MATIC at any time on a one-to-one basis (1 MATIC = 1 aMATICb). You will need to wait for 7 days for this transaction to complete.

# Micropool staking

Pooled staking removes the barriers to entry for people who want to participate in securing **Proof-of-stake (PoS) networks** such as ETH 2.0 (Beacon Chain). 

**Validators** are responsible for ensuring the integrity and validity of transactions on a PoS Network. By 'attesting' to the validity of new transactions and blocks, they are securing the running of the network. In return they receive rewards. Validators must provide a large deposit before they can set up a new Validator Node e.g. 32 ETH on the ETH 2.0 network. 

**Micropools** allow participants to contribute smaller asset amounts. These smaller amounts can then be 'pooled' with other stakers to create and run a new **Validator Node**. In return for your stake, you receive **Liquid Staking tokens** that can be used on other DeFi Platforms. 

We currently offer **ETH, AVAX & BNB** Staking with more opportunities coming soon.

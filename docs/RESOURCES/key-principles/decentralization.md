# Decentralization

Decentralization is a corner stone of Ankr's purpose.

It is the heart and driving force of Ankr. 

Ankr has launched over 15,000 nodes globally that support a thriving ecosystem of over 50 Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This infrastructure is fundamental to the provision of tools for a rapidly growing community of Web 3.0 developers. 

Through cloud computing, Ankr links together servers to create on-demand resources for those building decentralized apps, protocols, and smart contracts that contribute to a more connected and democratized version of the web. 

Ankr’s startup idea (and first whitepaper) sought to use idle processing power in data centers to build an open-source cloud called the DCCN or “distributed cloud computing network”. In this initial model, a user could run any application on the ANKR decentralized cloud service. 

Since then, Ankr has evolved to focus exclusively on serving the crypto economy with decentralized access to nodes for multiple use cases.

* Our nodes are distributed across ***independent third party data centers*** across multiple geographic locations.

* We ***never use centralized public cloud providers*** — other API providers typically use a centralized service like AWS. 

* As a crypto and blockchain native company, Ankr is **self-funded**. We are not beholden to investors, ***we are completely driven by our community***. This is paramount to avoiding the domination of a few players. 

* The Community owns and secures the service.

## We are on a path towards being a DAO.

Ankr is on a solid pathway towards being governed by its community through the ANKR DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Institutional investors will not be allowed to buy up the majority of tokens, hence ensuring the community is in power.

# Decentralization

Decentralization is a corner stone of Ankr's Purpose
Decentralization is at the heart of Ankr. We are on a path towards being a fully decenralized DAO .
Ankr has launched over 15,000 nodes globally that support a thriving ecosystem of over 50 Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This infrastructure is fundamental for contributing tools for a rapidly growing community of Web 3.0 developers. 

Through cloud computing, Ankr links together servers to create on-demand resources for those building decentralized apps, protocols, and smart contracts that contribute to a more connected and democratized version of the web. 

Ankr’s startup idea (and first whitepaper) sought to use idle processing power in data centers to build an open-source cloud called the DCCN or “distributed cloud computing network”. In this initial model, a user could run any application on the ANKR decentralized cloud service. Since then, Ankr has completed a pivot to focus exclusively on serving the crypto economy.

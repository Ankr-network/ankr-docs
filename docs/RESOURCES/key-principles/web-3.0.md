# Web 3.0

## Web 3.0 - The Next Generation of Internet
Mass adoption of Web 3.0 by individuals, developers and enterprises is key to securing the next stage of the internet.
The third generation of the internet is here but still under construction. The Web 3.0 movement refers to the building of an internet of decentralized networks that no single entity controls. It is a movement away from the centralized corporations that currently dominate the web and profit from the data users generate.

The key innovation of these networks is the creation of platforms that no single entity controls, yet everyone can still trust. The more participation on these networks - the greater the security for everybody.

Blockchain technology underlies the decentralization that is essential to the formation of Web 3.0 because it is open, trustless and permissionless. Decentralization and the enablement of value transfers between peers are the key building blocks of Web 3.0.

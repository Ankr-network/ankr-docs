# Earn Overview

Ankr Earn aims to bring the benefits of DeFi to the masses with the following solutions. 

## Liquid Staking

**Liquid Staking**
Liquid Staking extends the Staking experience to solve the problem of loss of liquidity and capital inefficiency. When assets are staked, they are usually locked up on-chain helping to maintain the network. However, Liquid Staking provides instant access to liquidity tokens that are equivalent in value to the stake in a 1:1 ratio. These portable liquidity tokens e.g. aMATICb, aETHb, aETHc, aAVAXb can be utilized on additional DeFi platforms to earn further rewards.

## Parachain Liquid Crowdloans
**Parachain Liquid Crowdloans** provide similar benefits to *Staking*. 

1. **Bond DOT/KSM**
Users bond DOT or KSM to a Polkadot project during a Parachain Slot Auction. 

2. **Locked Liquidity**
It the project wins a slot, the bonded DOT or KSM is inaccessible.

3. **Attain Instant Liquidity**
However, Parachain Liquid Staking tokens can be instantly obtained. These are portable and usable elsewhere. 

Token rewards from the winning project are distributed to Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders automatically. 

## DeFi

DeFi provides a single dashboard view of use cases for liquidity tokens.

## Ankr Bridge

Ankr Bridge brings cross-chain liquid staking to multiple chains to enable users to increase their yield opportunities.

Ankr Bridge is secured with ECDSA cryptography and a multi-party computation based Threshold Signature Scheme. This ensures that private keys are never exposed whilst mitigating against any single point of failure.

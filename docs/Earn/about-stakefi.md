​**StakeFi** is a platform to earn staking rewards in multiple ways. 

1. Pooled Staking

2. Liquidity Staking

3. Parachain Bonds

( 4. StakeFi Alpha* - *Platform to identify additional revenues across DeFi platforms. Coming Soon.*) 

StakeFi provides a simplified staking experience to users of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks and requires no specialist expertise, machinery or hardware to get started.

## What problems need solving in Traditional staking 
Traditional Staking presents barriers to the majority of people interested in becoming involved in Staking. Ankr removes these barriers to enable anybody to participate in staking opportunities.
​
### 1. Capital Inefficiency
* LOSS OF LIQUIDITY when funds are staked. 
* HIGH CAPITAL REQUIREMENT TO ACCESS STAKING REWARDS e.g. 32 ETH. Ankr solves this problem with Pooled Staking enabling individual participants to pool smaller amounts of crypto assets to collectively acquire the minimum required to run a node. 
* LOCKED FUNDS Assets are providing security to the network and are locked for that purpose. 

### 2. Technical Complexity
Serving as a validator is a technically complex and costly business demanding a high degree of expertise. There are high financial penalties - slashing - if an invalid transaction is wrongly validated or if a node goes offline.

## How Ankr solves these problems with StakeFi
Ankr StakeFi offers a range of solutions designed to ease complexity and enable mass adoption with a range of opportunities for anybody to get involved in staking with:
​ 
### 1. Pooled staking with low minimum assets to solve high capital requirement problem. 
To ensure wider participation, Pooled Staking allows a minimal amount of crypto assets to be deposited into Micropools. Currently ETH (0.5 ETH minimum), BNB (1 BNB minimum), AVAX (no minimum amount). 

### 2. Instant issuing of Liquidity tokens to solve locked value problem
Following successful staking, **Liquidity Tokens** are issued to stakers that can be immediately redeemed and utilized in a range of DeFi opportunities e.g. lending, yield farming etc. 

### 3. Instant issuing of Parachain Bonds
Depositing DOT or KSM on projects participating in Parachain Slot Auctions allows more people to support the project of their choice with a low commitment. Instant issuing of liquidity tokens allows participation in DeFi platforms.

# ETH FAQs

### Q. What is the minimum amount of ETH I can stake?

### A.

0.5 ETH

### Q. If I unstake is there a lead time required for this to happen or is it immediate?

### A.

It is not possible to unstake ETH until the Ethereum Network reaches phase 1.5 of its transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Phase 1.5 is expected in 2022, but the exact date is still unknown.&#x20;

However, you can trade your aETHb and aETHc tokens on DEXs at any time to effectively exit your staking position and reclaim the original value of your staked assets plus rewards. Once you trade aETHb or aETHc tokens for ETH or other tokens, you will no longer be able to unstake them on Ankr Earn.

### Q. How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

### A.

aETHb balances will increase with every rebase, rebase occurs daily. The value of aETHc appreciates gradually to reflect your staking rewards.&#x20;

### Q. How do I receive rewards?

### A.

You will see the aETHb balance in your wallet increase by a small amount every day in a process called rebasing to reflect your staking rewards. For aETHc, the value of your aETHc assets will appreciate to reflect your staking rewards.&#x20;

### Q. Does Ankr charge for the rebasing service?

### A.

Yes - each time a rebasing occurs, Ankr takes a small percentage. (The percentage is 2%).

### Q. How does a user find out current % earnings for ETH liquid staking?

### A.&#x20;

You will be able to see your estimated earnings within the Ankr Earn platform. You can find this amount displayed on the main staking card, and you can also access a rewards calculator to find a more exact number based on the amount you staked.

### Q. What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

### A.

This depends on the average staking period of Ankr Earn validator nodes, as well as ETH total supply.

### Q. Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

### A.

There is no slashing risk with ETH liquid staking on Ankr Earn. Even if the selected node providers are slashed for poorly performing nodes, stakers will always receive their rewards from the insurance policies that all node providers must have. This way, stakers face no adverse affects or penalties from slashing while their staked assets are promptly delegated to better nodes.



### Q. Which DeFi platforms have liquidity for aETHb and aETHc?

### A.

You can find a list of all decentralized exchanges and other places you can use aETHb and aETHc within the Ankr Boost tool on the Ankr Earn platform. This includes trading opportunities, liquidity mining opportunities, yield farming opportunities, and more.

### Q. What is the minimum amount of AVAX I can stake?

### A.

1 AVAX

### Q. If I unstake is there a lead time required for this to happen or is it immediate?

### A.

During the first few weeks, unstaking will be on hold to make sure that everything is working as planned. The first unstaking option will enable users to unstake by redeeming aAVAXb at fair value.

The fair amount of AVAX will be transferred to the user’s wallet at the end of the next staking period, which can take up to 14 days (new staking period every 14 days). The staking rewards between the redemption of aAVAXb and effective end of the staking period will be credited to the user’s wallet as well.

### Q. How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

### A.

aAVAXb will increase with every rebase, rebase occurs daily.

### Q. How do I receive rewards?

### A.

A rebase runs daily and rewards are received each time this runs. You will receive these rewards provided you hold AVAXb in your wallet, so you MUST claim the tokens out of Ankr Earn.

### A.

Yes - each time a rebase runs, we take a small percentage from this. The percentage is 2%

A. It will be published on Ankr StakeFi. As of July 1st 2021, the aAVAXb staking rewards APY were 7.82%, which is close to the 2-week Avalanche staking reward APR.

### Q. What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

### A.

It depends on the average staking period of Ankr StakeFi validator nodes, as well as AVAX total supply and size of the future instant liquidity pool (indirect cost for aAVAXb holders).

### Q. Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

### A.

There is no slashing risk with Avalanche staking. There is a requirement of minimum 60% uptime to receive rewards though.

### Q. Where can I use AVAXb? Can it be staked anywhere?

### A.

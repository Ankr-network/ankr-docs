:::info NOTE
Ankr Validator Node is ID 95
:::

With Fantom fluid staking, you can:

1. **Stake-as-you-go**: earn the base rate, and your capital is always unlocked. You’ll be able to claim your rewards every few epochs. APY: 4%

2. **Lock up your funds for any time you choose**: from a minimum of two weeks to a maximum of one year. You’ll earn rewards proportional to the time you decide to lock up your delegation, up to a maximum of 14% for the annual lock.
In this case, you’ll be able to claim your rewards every few epochs.

30% of the rewards will remain locked to cover potential early unlock penalties and become available once the lockup period expires.

:::note Important: 
The maximum lockup period available for you depends on the validator you choose. Validators can choose how long to lockup their FTM as well, up to a maximum of 12 months.

If the validator you chose isn’t locking up their FTM, you will only be able to stake as you go, with no lockup and 4% APY.

If the validator you chose is locking up for three months, for example, you’ll be able to lock up your FTM for three months maximum.

If the validator you chose is locking up for 12 months, you’ll be able to lock up your FTM for up to 12 months.

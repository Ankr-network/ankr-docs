# MATIC FAQs

### **Q: What is Polygon (MATIC) liquid staking?**

A: **Polygon Liquid Staking** offers **instant liquidity** for your staked **MATIC**. When you stake MATIC you can claim aMATICb tokens. These can be used with DeFi platforms to potentially earn additional layers of rewards.

The aMATICb token allows you to earn Alpha. Alpha (α) is a term used to describe a return that beats the normal crypto market. Also known as an excess return.

By staking aMATICb tokens on other DeFi platforms there is the potential to earn additional rewards.

### Q: What is the minimum amount of MATIC I can stake?

A: The minimum amount you can stake is **1 MATIC**.

### Q: If I unstake, is there a lead time before I can access my original MATIC stake or is it immediate?

A: Unstaking takes approximately 9 days (80 checkpoints). \


:::info
**Checkpoints** are a key part of the Matic protocol. They represents snapshots of the chain state and must be verified by ⅔+ of the validator set before they are confirmed and submitted on contracts deployed on Ethereum.

### Q: How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

A: aMATICb rewards arrive in your wallet with every rebase. Rebasing occurs daily.

### Q: How do I receive rewards?

A: A rebase runs daily and rewards are received each time this runs. You receive these rewards directly to your wallet - assuming you hold aMATICb.


### Q: What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

A: Rewards for your staked MATIC are received at each check point (epoch) in the MATIC protocol. In most cases the duration of the epoch is less than 30 minutes.

At this point your total reward amount is based on the share of MATIC you have staked as a fraction of the total MATIC value controlled by Ankr Earn.&#x20;

The rebase happens every 24 hours with a target price of 1 staked MATIC.&#x20;

If you have staked MATIC and claimed aMATICb tokens in your wallet. The reward you receive can be explained with the following example:

* Let's say that Maya has 1 staked MATIC and 1 aMATICb in her wallet.&#x20;
* She receives 0.1 staking rewards.&#x20;
* Now the value of her staked MATIC is 1.1.

Since 1 aMATICb token always represents 1 staked MATIC token (which can be unstaked at some point) rebasing seeks to restore equivalency. In other words, the rebasing mechanism always attempts to keep 1 aMATICb token equivalent to 1 staked MATIC token.&#x20;

* So in this example, the rebase adjustment will be 1/1.1=0.9090
* Now Maya's aMATICb token holding is worth 1.1 and this increase is received directly to her wallet.&#x20;

### Q: Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

A: Even if the selected node providers are slashed for poorly performing nodes, stakers will always receive their rewards from the insurance policies that all node providers must have. This way, stakers face no adverse effects or penalties from slashing while their staked assets are promptly delegated to better nodes.

### Q: Where can I use aMATICb token? Can it be used anywhere?

A: You can find all DEXs and other places that host the aMATICb token within the Ankr Boost tool on the Ankr Earn platform. This includes trading opportunities, liquidity mining opportunities, yield farming opportunities, and more.

### Which wallets are compatible with the aMATICb token?&#x20;

A: The aMATICb tokens are ERC-20 tokens that can be safely stored on wallets like MetaMask that support these token types.&#x20;

### Q: How do I set up my wallet for Polygon Liquid Staking?

A: Check out these instructions to set up your Metamask wallet.\

# BNB FAQs

### **Q. What is Binance Coin (BNB) liquid staking?**

### **A.**

**BNB Liquid Staking** offers **instant liquidity** for your staked BNB. When you stake BNB you can claim reward-earning aBNBb tokens. These can be used with DeFi platforms to potentially earn additional layers of rewards.

The aBNBb token allows you to earn Alpha. Alpha (α) is a term used to describe a return that beats the normal crypto market. Also known as an excess return.&#x20;

By staking aBNBb tokens on other DeFi platforms there is the potential to earn additional rewards.

### Q. What is the minimum amount of BNB I can stake?

### A.

The minimum amount you can stake is **1 BNB**.

### Q. **What is the unbonding period of aBNBb?**

### A.

The unbonding period is **7 days**.

### Q. How do I receive rewards?

### A.&#x20;

aBNBb is a rebasing token. When holding aBNBb, your balance will increase in proportion to your BNB staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So each day, you will see the quantity of your aBNBb increase by a small amount.

### Q. How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

### A.

Your aBNBb balance will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily.

### Q. Does Ankr charge for this service?

### A.

Ankr does not charge any service fees for BNB Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a delegate stake fee (Ankr’s validator node charges 2%), representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders. Ankr's income comes from running one of the several validator nodes that will be used to stake BNB.

### Q. What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

### A.

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to. Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trusted and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.

### Q. Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

### A.

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time the validator their BNB is staked with is “in jail” (slashed). However, delegated staked BNB will not be slashed, and slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

### Q. Where can I use aBNBb tokens? Can they be used anywhere?

### A.&#x20;

You can find all DEXs and other places that host the aBNBb token within the [Ankr Boost](https://www.ankr.com/earn/boost/trade/?from=aETHb\&to=ETH) tool on the Ankr Earn platform. This will include trading opportunities, liquidity mining opportunities, yield farming opportunities, and more.

### Which wallets are compatible with the aBNBb token?&#x20;

### A.&#x20;

The aBNBb tokens are ERC-20 tokens that can be safely stored on wallets like MetaMask that support these token types.&#x20;

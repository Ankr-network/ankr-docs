# BNB Delegate Staking

**Binance Smart Chain** relies on a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA)

You can become a delegator and stake your assets e.g. BNB to a validator of your choice e.g. Ankr Validators. 

When you stake with your preferred validator and help them achieve a greater proportion of the staked distribution.  

BNB holders can earn 10-30% APR by delegating their BNB

ANKR takes 0% commission, allowing BNB holders to maximize earnings. Our Developer API paid service subsidizes our costs for running the validator.

### BNB Staking Benefits

Ankr is one of the most profitable ways to stake BNB as we are the only validator that charges no commission fees.

* **Higher APY & No Commission Fees** - Ankr charges no commission fees as a BSC validator, meaning more earnings for you. We consistently reward one of the largest APYs of any staking solution on the BSC.
* **Support and secure the Binance Smart Chain** - Staking BNB directly supports the Binance platform and helps validate transactions on the network.
* **Security & Safety** - Keep all funds in your own wallets and hold custody of your keys at all times.

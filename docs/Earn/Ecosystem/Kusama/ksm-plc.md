By solving the capital inefficiency of Parachain slot auctions with Parachain Liquid Crowdloans, Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders benefit from:

## Benefits

1. **Liquidity**: Parachain Liquid Crowdloans enable liquidity on bonded DOT through an upcoming auction marketplace on [Bounce Finance](https://bounce.finance).

To compensate contributors for the illiquidity risk of bonding KSM/DOT for up to 48 weeks/24 months, rewards are expected to be significantly higher than KSM/DOT staking.

3. **Lending/Borrowing**: [OnX Finance](https://onx.finance) is developing a lending contract enabling it to collateralize Parachain Bonds and borrow DOT, which can be used to free up liquidity, or buy more Parachain Bonds on [Bounce Finance](https://bounce.finance).

4.  **Opportunity to become a DeFi Parachain Crowdloan Market Maker**

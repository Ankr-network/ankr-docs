Liquidity is available via Auction Marketplaces and Lending Platforms

# What can I do with Parachain Liquid Crowdloan Tokens?

### Auction Marketplace **Liquidity**

Parachain Liquid Crowdloan tokens are liquid assets. Their liquidity is enabled via the [Bounce Finance auction marketplace](https://bounce.finance).

Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders have the opportunity to sell their tokens and obtain liquidity. We expect the circulating supply for each of the Parachain Liquid Crowdloan tokens to be limited and trading volume to be low as there are likely to be several Parachain Liquid Crowdloan tokens arising from every Parachain slot auction winning project.

There are two types of auction system –

1. **Fixed swap auction** – As the name suggests the price of Parachain Liquid Crowdloan tokens are fixed and there is instant execution of an order upon an offer to buy the bond.
2. **Sealed-bid auction** – This auction is time bound and all offers above the minimum amount are considered at expiry of the deadline. The highest offer is executed.

We believe that an auction marketplace is more appropriate. This is very similar to how Fixed Income products are traded in traditional finance (banks and/or brokers are always available to buy/sell specific bonds at a specific buy price (bid) and sell price (ask).

The spread between both prices is called the bid/ask spread. There is no counterparty risk related to the liquidity of Parachain Liquid Crowdloans as the liquidity is expected to come from the market.

### **Lending on OnX Finance**

With [OnX Finance](https://onx.finance), Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders are able to lend by collateralizing yield generating tokens such as Parachain Liquid Crowdloan tokens and borrowing tokens with non-generating yield such as DOT.

Given the lack of DEX liquidity, OnX Finance lending is expected to work based on _Fair Value_ (1 aDOTp = DOT assuming that higher yield compensates higher liquidity risk), applying a conservative Loan-to-Value ratio (e.g. 75% for Ankr Eth2 Reward Bearing Bond).

The Parachain Liquid Bonding token and the borrowed amount should ideally be on the same chain or network. Therefore, we can expect three solutions under that scenario:

1. **Usage of onDOT (ERC-20) for borrowing**.

Polkadot stablecoin backed by Polkadot Internet Bonds (ERC-20 tokens)

2.  **Deployment of Lending Contract to Binance Smart Chain** 

Thus bridging _Parachain Liquid Bonding + Rewards_ to Binance Smart Chain

3. **Cross-chain Lending**

DOT lending supply on Polkadot network and collateral (Parachain Liquid Crowdloans) on Ethereum

The quickest solution to implement would likely be the usage of onDOT as lending supply under OnX Finance. As Polkadot Internet Crowdloans will enable unstaking, aDOTp is expected to have an elastic supply, which should provide a robust price stability mechanism without counting too much on the size of the total liquidity of aDOTp. As such, it is unlikely to observe strong price discounts for Polkadot Internet Bonds as well as onDOT as onDOT will be pegged to Polkadot Internet Bond value.

onDOT would therefore become an alternative source of lending supply to Polkadot on Ethereum.

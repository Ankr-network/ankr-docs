# What is Smart Staking?
Smart Staking provides a one-click staking experience using liquid staking as collateral to fully represent the staked assets. 

# Key Benefits
* One-click staking experience
* Non-custodial staking experience
* Lower staking requirement than staking nodes (e.g. min. 0.5 ETH instead of 32 ETH for one staking node)
* Powered by the most scalable staking infrastructure - liquid staking

# How does it work?
1. Deposit ETH or any PoS native token 
Deposit assets from any Proof-of-Stake chain supported by Ankr liquid staking. 
These are deposited into a smart contract from Ankr. Alternatively, if you are a company, you can provide your own smart contract if you want to enable smart staking for your own customers.

2. Receive Liquid Staking Tokens
The smart contract receives liquid staking tokens (from either Ankr or the market depending on the best price).

3. Depositors can withdraw using two options
*Claim liquid staking token* from the smart contract.

*Unstake* The smart contract redeems liquid staking tokens to Ankr and receives funds at the end of the unbonding period (e.g. every 28 days for aAVAXb, 3-4 days for aMATICb, 7 days for aBNBb)

Ankr Earn solves key issues with Traditional Staking

## **The Problem with Traditional staking**  

## Capital Inefficiency

### Loss of Liquidity 
When assets are staked on a chain they are typically locked until the end of the staking period. Staked assets are important to the networks they are staked on as they used to participate in on-chain activities and provide security for the network. This loss of liquidity is a significant barrier to staking. 

### High Capital Requirement to Access Staking Rewards
Typically, staking on PoS chains requires a high deposit. For example, to stake on Ethereum 2.0 directly requires a minimum stake 32 ETH. This is a big commitment of approximately $85,000. 

Ankr removes this barrier by enabling participants to stake smaller amounts towards the running of a node. Rewards are then distributed proportionally.

**LOCKED FUNDS** Assets are providing security to the network and are locked for that purpose. Not being able to re-use the bonds.

### :two: **Technical Complexity**

Serving as a validator is a technically complex and costly business demanding a high degree of expertise. There are high financial penalties - slashing - if an invalid transaction is wrongly validated or if a node goes offline.

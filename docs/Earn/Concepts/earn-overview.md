# Earn Overview

Ankr Earn aims to bring the benefits of DeFi to the masses with the following solutions. 

## Staking

1. **Smart Staking**
Smart Staking allows participants to perform one-click staking. Participants can contribute their resources and stake assets such as MATIC, ETH and AVAX on chain. These opportunities are inclusive and typically only require a minimum of 1 MATIC, ETH or AVAX. Staking is an important way to support a blockchain network and contribute to its security. In return, participants receive rewards. 

2. **Liquid Staking**
Liquid Staking extends the Smart Staking experience to solve the problem of loss of liquidity and capital inefficiency. When assets are staked, they are usually locked up on-chain helping to maintain the network. However, Liquid Staking provides instant access to liquidity tokens that are equivalent in value to the stake in a 1:1 ratio. These portable liquidity tokens e.g. aMATICb, aETHb, aETHc, aAVAXb can be utilized on additional DeFi platforms to earn further rewards.

## Parachain Liquid Crowdloans
**Parachain Liquid Crowdloans** provide similar benefits to *Staking*. 

1. **Bond DOT/KSM**
Users bond DOT or KSM to a Polkadot project during a Parachain Slot Auction. 

2. **Locked Liquidity**
It the project wins a slot, the bonded DOT or KSM is inaccessible.

3. **Attain Instant Liquidity**
However, Parachain Liquid Staking tokens can be instantly obtained. These are portable and usable elsewhere. 

Token rewards from the winning project are distributed to Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders automatically. 

## Ankr Boost

Ankr Boost provides a single dashboard view of aggregated real-time data feeds. Ankr Boost can be used to help users boost their staking rewards and yield farming strategies.

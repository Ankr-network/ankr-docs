## **The Problem with Traditional staking** <a href="#the-problem-with-traditional-staking" id="the-problem-with-traditional-staking"></a>

Traditional Staking presents barriers to the majority of people interested in becoming involved in Staking. Ankr removes these barriers to enable anybody to participate in staking opportunities.

### :one: **Capital Inefficiency**

**LOSS OF LIQUIDITY** these funds are then locked until the current Ethereum mainnet merges with the beacon chain estimated to be in 2022. This loss of liquidity presents another barrier to staking.

**HIGH CAPITAL REQUIREMENT TO ACCESS STAKING REWARDS** Currently, a deposit contract to run a Validator node on the ETH2 beacon chain is 32 ETH. This is a big commitment of approximately $84,779 (as of August 1st 2021) and is a significant barrier to many crypto enthusiasts keen to run a node. Ankr solves this problem with Pooled Staking enabling individual participants to pool smaller amounts of crypto assets to collectively acquire the minimum required to run a node.\
\
**LOCKED FUNDS** Assets are providing security to the network and are locked for that purpose. Not being able to re-use the bonds.

### :two: **Technical Complexity**

Serving as a validator is a technically complex and costly business demanding a high degree of expertise. There are high financial penalties - slashing - if an invalid transaction is wrongly validated or if a node goes offline.

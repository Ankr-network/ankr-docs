**Ankr Earn** provides a simplified staking experience to users of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks and requires no specialist expertise, machinery, or hardware to get started. 

**Ankr Earn** solves the problems associated with traditional staking opportunities.

## **The Problem with Traditional staking** <a href="#the-problem-with-traditional-staking" id="the-problem-with-traditional-staking"></a>

Traditional Staking presents barriers to the majority of people interested in becoming involved in Staking. 

## Capital Inefficiency

### Loss of Liquidity 
When assets are staked on a chain they are typically locked until the end of the staking period. This loss of liquidity is a significant barrier to staking. 

For example, staking ETH locks these funds until the current Ethereum mainnet merges with the Proof of Stake Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain. Until then ETH assets are inaccessible. 

### High Capital Requirement to Access Staking Rewards
Currently, a deposit contract to run a Staking/Validator node on Ethereum 2.0 is 32 ETH. This is a big commitment of approximately $85,000 at the time of writing. It is a significant barrier to many crypto fans who would like to be involved in Staking. 

Ankr solves this problem with Pooled Staking enabling individual participants to pool smaller amounts of crypto assets to collectively acquire the minimum required to run a node.\
\
**LOCKED FUNDS** Assets are providing security to the network and are locked for that purpose. Not being able to re-use the bonds.

### :two: **Technical Complexity**

Serving as a validator is a technically complex and costly business demanding a high degree of expertise. There are high financial penalties - slashing - if an invalid transaction is wrongly validated or if a node goes offline.

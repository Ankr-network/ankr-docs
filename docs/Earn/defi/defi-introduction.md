# DeFi

The number of DeFi projects continues to grow as we enter another wave of decentralized finance applications. 

Ankr DeFi can support you with finding use cases for Liquid Staking tokens and assets. 


### What is Redemption Value of Liquid Staking tokens?

The Redemption Value or Fair Value represents the ratio at which users can stake/unstake 1 token. For reward earning tokens i.e. aETHb the ratio is always 1. This is because any difference is passed to your wallet as a type of staking reward resulting from rebasing.

The Redemption Value of aETHc is always higher than 1. This is because staking rewards accumulate and can be realized when users unstake. The Ratio or Redemption Value of aETHc is therefore continuously increasing together with ETH staking rewards.

The aETHc ratio is also applied when staking ETH to avoid existing stakers being diluted by new stakers. In other words, if the redemption value of 1 aETHc is 1.05 ETH, a new user willing to stake ETH will get 1/1.05 = 0.9524 aETHc for staking 1 ETH.

## What is Smart Staking?
Smart Staking provides a One-Click staking experience using liquid staking as collateral to fully represent staked assets. 

### Key Benefits
* One-click staking experience
* Non-custodial staking experience
* Lower staking requirement than staking nodes (e.g. min. 0.5 ETH instead of 32 ETH for one staking node)
* Powered by the most scalable staking infrastructure - liquid staking

### How does it work?
Liquid staking is enabled through a smart contract from Ankr. You can also use your own smart contract if you want to enable smart staking for your own customers.

#### STEP ONE 
Deposit ETH or any native token from a Proof-of-Stake chain that Ankr supports.

#### STEP TWO
The smart contract buys liquid staking tokens at the best price. These may be from Ankr or the market. 

#### STEP THREE 
Depositors can withdraw using two options:

1. Claim liquid staking token from the smart contract.
2. Unstake (smart contract redeems liquid staking token to Ankr) and receive funds at the end of the unbonding period (e.g. every 28 days for aAVAXb, 3-4 days for aMATICb, 7 days for aBNBb)

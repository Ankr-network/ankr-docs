## What is Delegate Staking?

Delegate staking enables the staking of assets to a validator of your choice. This works well when there are a limited number of validators. When you stake assets with your preferred validator you can help them achieve a greater proportion of the staked distribution. 

Validators with the most delegated assets have the greatest chance of validating transactions and producing blocks. In return, they receive rewards from the gas consumption of transactions.

This means that the chosen validator has a greater share of earnings to distribute to Delegators.

### Binance Smart Chain 

Binance Smart Chain relies on a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA)

PoSA is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner.

You can become a delegator and stake your assets e.g. BNB to a validator of your choice e.g. Ankr Validators.

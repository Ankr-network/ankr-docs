## What is Delegate Staking?

Delegator staking takes the complexity out of validator staking.

You can become a delegator and stake your assets e.g. BNB to a validator of your choice. Through staking you choose your preferred validator and help them achieve a greater proportion of the staked distribution. In return the validator shares a portion of its earnings with its delegators. 

Ankr is consistently in the top 3 Validators on BNB.

## Delegate Staking

Delegate staking enables the staking of assets to a validator of your choice. This works well when there are a limited number of validators. When you stake assets with your preferred validator you can help them achieve a greater proportion of the staked distribution. 

Validators with the most delegated assets have the greatest chance of validating transactions and producing blocks. In return, they receive rewards from the gas consumption of transactions.

This means that the chosen validator has a greater share of earnings to distribute to Delegators.

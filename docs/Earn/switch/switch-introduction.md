# Ankr Switch

## What is Ankr Switch?

Ankr Switch is a product for switching between reward earning tokens and reward bearing tokens for the same asset. For example, aETHb and aETHc.

### What are reward bearing and rewards earning tokens?

They are tokens issued to you by Ankr when staking with Arnk Earn.  These tokens are in a 1:1 ratio to your staked assets.

There are two types of Liquid Staking tokens:

* Reward earning tokens — represent the staked assets plus all future staking rewards. These grow in value as they accumulate rewards.  
* Rewards bearing tokens — represent the staked assets. These grow in number as they accumulate rewards.  

The main difference between reward earning and reward bearing tokens is the former distribute staking rewards through a rebasing process on a daily basis, meaning that its fair value should be equal to original asset price, contrary to the latter, whose fair price is original asset + staking rewards.

### Supported tokens

Currently, Ankr Switch supports switching between:

* aETHb–aETHc — both directions.

## Why Ankr Switch?

### User's benefits

Having staked your ETH, you may discover an exciting opportunity you don't want to miss.
Ethereum, however, doesn't support the unstaking functionality yet.

You may apply a crypto arbitrage strategy, where discovering the current aETHb price <  aETHc price, you can switch aETHb to aETHc and sell them on a DEX for a better profit.

### Ankr's benefits

Why did we need a switch?

* Linked pricing to avoid possible widening gap between the price of aETHb and aETHc.   

* Many DeFi platforms and CEXs/DEXs don't support aETHb tokens. They cannot integrate ERC-20-like aETHb, but they can integrate ERC-20 aETHc.

# Bridge Tokens

:::info

Current Bridge version supports bridging aMATICb. Other assets will be added in later releases. 

:::

## Bridge aMATICb

1. Visit [Ankr Bridge](https://www.ankr.com/earn/bridge/). The aMATICb token is chosen by default. 
2. Enter the desired aMATICb amount to bridge.
3. Click *Switch network*  to select the correct source and destination networks. Confirm the switch in your wallet.
4. Click *Approve* to allow Ankr Earn to access your aMATICb and confirm it in your wallet.
5. Click *Send* to deposit aMATICb to the destination network and confirm it in your wallet.
   1. We recommend choosing the high fee value for faster transaction mining time.
6. Ankr Bridge shows you the sending progress. Wait till the cross-chain transaction successfully finishes. 
   1. Please stay on the page until sending is completed, since next you need to **receive** the bridged tokens. If navigated away, closed the tab, or Ankr Bridge failed during the bridging process, read the **Finish Bridge** section below.
7. To receive the bridged aMATICb on the destination network, switch to it network by clicking *Switch to **** and confirm switching in your wallet.
8. Receive aMATICb on the destination network clicking *Receive* and confirming it in your wallet. Gas fee applies.
   1. You can see the transaction in the explorer by clicking the *go-to* button next to the transaction hash.

## Finish Bridge

*Finish Bridge* allows you to get back to the bridging process if anything failed. 

Brinding process may fail due to: 
* You navigating away from the Bridge page anytime during the process.
* You closing the page anytime during the process.
* Ankr Bridge failures due to network stability and other possible issues. 

If the process failed anywhere before Step 5 from **Bridge aMATICb**, no action is needed. Just start bridging again.

If the process failed at Step 5 or later: 
1. Open your wallet, find and copy the transaction ID from the **Deposit** operation.
2. Visit [Ankr Bridge](https://www.ankr.com/earn/bridge/). 
3. Click *Finish Bridge*.
4. Paste the deposit transation ID in the form and click *Proceed bridge*.
5. Check that it brought you to the **Sending progress** page, then continue from Step 6 from **Bridge aMATICb**.

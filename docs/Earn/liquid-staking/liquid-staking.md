Liquid Staking provides instant liquidity for staked assets in the form of liquid staking tokens. 

Liquid staking tokens represent the value of your staked assets but the tokens are portable, accessible and thus liquid. They can now be utilized in a number of ways.

For example,

1. **Provide liquidity on Decentralized Exchanges**
Pairs of tokens for example liquid token aAVAXb and AVAX can be deposited in liquidity pools on a number of DEXs such as Uniswap. By providing liquidity, you can earn additional rewards.  As more people trade, you can earn a share of transaction fees (Liquidity Mining), on top of your AVAX staking rewards from aAVAXb.

2. **Receiving additional tokens from DEXs**
By providing liquidity, you also have the possibility of receiving farming rewards or tokens on top of Liquidity Pool tokens, representing your share of a liquidity pool on a DEX.

3. **Earn more yield**
You can harvest the farmed tokens and stake those tokens as well to earn more yield, or simply sell them to buy more AVAX and aAVAXb to generate more yield. Repeating this operation periodically can add a compounding effect to yield.

## How do I get Liquid Staking Tokens?

Liquid Staking tokens are automatically issued to your Ankr Earn Dashboard when you successfully stake assets such as ETH, AVAX, FTM, BNB.

For example,

1. AVAX liquid staking tokens - aAVAXb and AVAX pairs can be used to provide liquidity to aAVAXb/AVAX liquidity pools on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). As more people trade, you can earn a share of transaction fees (Liquidity Mining), on top of your AVAX staking rewards from aAVAXb.

2. By providing liquidity, you also have the possibility of receiving farming rewards on top of Liquidity Pool tokens, representing your share of a liquidity pool on a DEX.

3. You can harvest the farmed tokens and stake those tokens as well to earn more yield, or simply sell them to buy more AVAX and aAVAXb to generate more yield. Repeating this operation periodically will add a compounding effect on my yield.

:::info
There are two types of liquid staking tokens:

1. Reward bearing tokens (e.g. aETHc, formerly known as aETH or AnkrETH)
2. Reward earning tokens (e.g. aAVAXb or aETHb, formerly known as fETH)

### Liquid Staking Benefits

The benefits of Liquid Staking depend on your choice of staked asset.

#### 1. Liquidity

When you stake ETH and receive Liquid Tokens (aETHb, aETHc) the main benefit is the liquidity as it is not possible to unstake ETH for the moment until phase 1.5 of Ethereum 2.0.

#### 2. Elastic Supply

For chains that allow unstaking such as Avalanche, the beneift is the elastic supply of Liquid Staking tokens. 

*Elastic Supply Tokens* work in such a way that the circulating supply expands or contracts to offset changes in a token's price via rebasing. When you stake AVAX and receive liquid tokens aAVAXb, the circulating supply of aAVAXb increases. When you want to unstake your AVAX, you must return your aAVAXb to Ankr Earn. Your aAVAXb is burnt and AVAX is returned to you.The circulating supply of aAVAXb decreases. 

#### 3. Price Stability 

The Elastic supply feature of liquid staking has an important impact on the price stability of liquid staking tokens. 

ETH liquid staking price stability is based mainly on the amount of liquidity in DEXs. However, with AVAX liquid staking, the price stability is less dependent on the amount of liquidity in a DEX because any price deviation of aAVAXb creates a trading opportunity for other users. Other users can buy aAVAXb at a discount and then return aAVAXb to Ankr Earn(unstake) to claim the aAVAXb fair value. In doing so, a gain can be realized once the unstaking lock-up period, of 28 days for aAVAXb has passed.

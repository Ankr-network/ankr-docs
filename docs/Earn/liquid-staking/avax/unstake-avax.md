## Overview

If you decide to unstake, it can take 4 weeks before you can claim your funds.

:::info Before you start

You need to have a small AVAX amount to cover the gas fee for the outgoing transactions.

Unstaking AVAX tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the AVAX smart contracts deployed in Avalanche.

Ankr Earn deducts a 2% fee from the staking reward when you unstake.

AVAX tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

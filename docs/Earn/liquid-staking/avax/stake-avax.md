## Where to get AVAX tokens

There are several ways how to buy AVAX tokens:

### A. Centralized exchanges 
(e.g. Coinbase, Binance) supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* Buy AVAX on a centralized exchange
* Withdraw **AVAX** to **AVAX C-Chain**

### B. Centralized exchanges NOT supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* If the exchange you are using does not support AVAX C-Chain, you must withdraw to **AVAX X-Chain** address using [AVAX Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network).

* Go to [https://wallet.avax.network/](https://wallet.avax.network)

* From the left menu, select "**Cross-Chain**

2. Select "**C Contract**" as the Source Chain

3. Enter your MetaMask wallet address by copying and pasting it into the **To Address** field on your Avalanche wallet.

4. Confirm, and finalize the transaction.

### C. Use [**Avalanche Bridge**](https://bridge.avax.network/login) 

Get free AVAX to trade on decentralized exchange on the Avalanche network.

1. Transfer tokens through [Avalanche Bridge](https://bridge.avax.network/login) using your Metamask browser extension (Ethereum network).

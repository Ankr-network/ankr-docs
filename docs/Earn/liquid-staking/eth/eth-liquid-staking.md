[Ankr Earn](https://stakefi.Ankr.com/liquid-staking/launchpad) offers ETH holders the opportunity to stake ETH and claim aETHb.

aETHb is a reward-earning token, meaning that rewards from Ethereum staking will be distributed daily through rebasing and aETHb holders' balance in their wallet will increase on a daily basis.

:::caution Be Aware!

It is not possible to unstake ETH until the Ethereum Network reaches phase 1.5 of its transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Phase 1.5 is expected in 2022, but the exact date is still unknown.

### Ankr Reward-Earning Staked ETH (aETHb)

Similar to aETHc, aETHb (formerly fETH) also enables instant liquidity for staked ETH tokens in ETH 2.0 network.

The main difference between aETHb and aETHc is that it distributes staking rewards through a rebasing process on a daily basis, meaning that its fair value should be equal to ETH price, contrary to aETHc, whose fair price is ETH + staking rewards embedded in aETHc (1 aETHc represents 1.04 ETH as of August 2021).

Ankr Earn receives daily ETH rewards into the ETH2 staking pool, which are then reflected in aETHb holdersâ€™ wallets. As a result, the amount of aETHb that users hold in their wallet automatically increase with every daily rebase.

The rebase adjustment represents the staking rewards.

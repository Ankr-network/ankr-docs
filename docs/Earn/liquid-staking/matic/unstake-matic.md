## Overview

If you decide to unstake, it can take 3-4 days before you can claim your funds. Throughout this period, your MATIC will continue to **earn staking rewards**.

:::info Before you start

Ensure you have ANKR for the unstaking fee (500–3500 on average) and a small amount of ETH for the dynamic gas fee (approx. 0.0005).

Unstaking MATIC tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the MATIC smart-contracts deployed in Ethereum.

Ankr Earn covers the gas fee cost and charges a small fee in ANKR.

MATIC tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

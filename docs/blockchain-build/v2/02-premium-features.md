# Get Started

**Ankr Premium Plan** gives you access to dedicated endpoints (https and wss) and additional exclusive features.

Premium RPC Endpoints are **secure** and **private** endpoints exclusive to you. Premium endpoints provide greater reliability by interfacing with a fully distributed, ultra low latency node pool. This node network infrastructure is distinct from the public community RPC network infrastructure.

## Features

1. Dedicated RPC API (https) endpoint
2. Dedicated Websocket (wss) endpoint
3. Access to Advanced APIs

## Benefits

Enjoy the following benefits:

* At times of network congestion, Ankr Premium requests are prioritized.&#x20;
* Establish a durable, low-latency connection via the websocket endpoint and have data pushed incrementally directly to you as soon as it is available. This makes it ideal for real-time data analytics

:::warning

The Websocket API limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections to provide protection against misuse e.g. DDoS attacks, for example. If your Websocket client makes too many connections at the same time, an error message will be received.

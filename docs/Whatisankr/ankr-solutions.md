# Why Ankr?

The Ankr team has deep expertise in enabling services like node hosting and API access. 

In 2017, Ankr founders pioneered the harnessing of cloud computing power left idle in data centers all over the world and reallocating it to enabling services like node hosting and API access. The ANKR token was introduced as a payment method for services and became one of the top 20 traded tokens on Coinbase. 

Ankr built a unique niche for itself as the only platform that combines node infrastructure and staking with DeFi to make developing and earning easy setting the stage for **Ankr Earn**.

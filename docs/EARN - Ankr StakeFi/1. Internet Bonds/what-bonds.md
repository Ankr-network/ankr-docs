# What are Internet Bonds

## Background
### Internet Bonds are solving a problem
Internet Bonds solve the problem of locked up liquidity when staking assets on Proof-of-Stake networks.

Staking rewards from Proof-of-Stake networks can be one of the most stable streams of income available (in percentage terms). However typically you have to wait until the end of the staking period to realize your staking rewards. 

For example, if I stake 0.5 ETH on the Beacon Chain today, I lose access to that staked ETH and I won’t realize any rewards until late 2021/2022. This is because the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake network won’t be launched until the minimum genesis threshold of 16,384 validators or 524,288 ETH (genesis/32) is reached. Until this security threshold is reached, rewards will not be issued to anyone that deposits ETH.

So in the meantime, I have no access to my stake, nor do I have any income from rewards. 

## Liquidity Staking
### Ankr Internet Bonds as a Solution

The 0.5 ETH that I successfully staked on the Beacon Chain is immediately represented by Internet Bonds issued directly to my StakeFi Dashboard. These Bonds are equivalent in value to my staked 0.5 ETH. However, I can now utilize these Bonds in a number of ways. 

For example, 

1. I can use my Internet Bond - aETH and ETH to provide liquidity to aETH pools on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). As more people trade, I can earn a share of transaction fees. (Liquidity Mining)
2. By providing liquidity, I also receive farming rewards.
3. I can stake those farming rewards on the DEX and earn more farming rewards and also earn a share of transaction fees involving the farming reward.

## What do Internet Bonds do?
Internet Bonds are automatically issued to your StakeFi Dashboard when you successfully stake ETH in the form of aETHb and aETHc and AVAX in the form of aAVAXb. Internet Bonds are equivalent in value to the staked tokens.

### Internet Bonds as Elastic Supply Tokens
Elastic supply tokens work in such a way that the circulating supply expands or contracts to offset changes in a token's price via rebasing. 

The target price of 1 aETHc is 1 ETH. The challenge is how to maintain that price stability in the face of changing market conditions. 

The answer is to alter the circulating supply of aETHc so that less aETHc in circulation brings the price up whereas more brings it down. The mechanism to alter the circulating supply is called Rebasing. 

So if the price of 1 aETHc is above 1 ETH, rebasing increases the current supply to bring the price down.

If the price of 1 aETHc is less than 1 ETH, rebasing decreases the current supply to bring the price up. 

The difference between the previous and current rebasing update is distributed amongst Bond holders and automatically reflected in your wallet without requiring any action at all from the holder.

### Risks
Rebasing can amplify your gains to the upside, but it can also amplify your losses. If rebases occur while the bond price is going down, you may suffer impermanent loss as the token price goes down. You may also own fewer bonds after each rebase. However, this impermanent loss is only realized if you redeem your bonds

In recent years, the number of blockchain-based video games with active users has skyrocketed thanks to play-to-earn (P2E) value models and the success demonstrated by early Web3 gaming projects like Axie Infinity.

Non-Fungible Tokens “NFTs” are of special relevance to game developers that want to include in-game currency. By implementing an NFT, in-game characters and items can be truly held by the player eliminating the possibility of losing acquired items due to lost login credentials or account termination. 

Today, the Web3 gaming industry is booming; it grew by [765% in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/01/25/does-blockchain-herald-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-for-gaming/?sh=10d21ecf6827). 

The biggest challenge to its continued adoption, however, is the technical difficulty involved with creating a Web3 game. That’s where Ankr Game SDKs comes in.

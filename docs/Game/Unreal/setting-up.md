Ankr Unreal SDK is designed for Unreal Engine v.4.27.2 but as soon as v5 is released an update will follow. 

:::

## Prerequisites

You will need **Unreal Engine** to be installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have it yet, sign up and download the **Creator's License** from the [official website](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).

1. Install or open the Epic Games launcher.
2. Sign into the Epic Games launcher  
3. On the Unreal Engine tab, click the Install Engine button to download and install the latest version of Unreal Engine. 

### Project installation

1. Download the latest release of 'AnkrSDK.zip' package from https://github.com/Ankr-network/game-unreal-sdk/releases.

2. Open your project folder '[ProjectName].uproject'

3. Create a folder called 'Plugins'

3. Unzip the 'AnkrSDK.zip' folder into the 'Plugins' folder.

4. Delete Binaries, Intermediate, Saved folders and Visual Studio Project file (.sln) from Unreal Project (If any)

#### Generate a Visual Studio Project

1. Generate a Visual Studio Project by Right-Clicking '[ProjectName].uproject' and selecting 'Generate Visual Studio project files.'

2. Open the generated 'Visual Studio solution file (.sln)' and check if the plugin in included in the solution explorer.

3. Locate *GameInstance.h* if already created. If not Add C++ class from **Content Browser**, check 'Show All Classes' and select 'GameInstance'. Name your class 'MyGameInstance'.

Open `MyGameInstance.h` and include the following code:

```c++
   #include "MirageClient.h"

   UPROPERTY()
   UMirageClient* mirageClient;

   UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "ANKR SDK")
   UMirageClient* GetMirageClient();
```

4. Open `MyGameInstance.cpp` and include the following code:

```c++
UMirageClient* UMyGameInstance::GetMirageClient()
{
	if (mirageClient == nullptr)
	{
		mirageClient = NewObject<UMirageClient>();
	}

	return mirageClient;
}
```

#### Add AnkrSDK to Build.cs

Add "AnkrSDK" to your Unreal Project/Source/Unreal Project/Build.cs as shown below:

```c++
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "AnkrSDK" });
```

Click ***Edit->Project Settings->Maps and Modes*** and select your newly created or already created 'GameInstance' from the 'GameInstance Class' dropdown.

Now you can call all the functions in blueprint by getting 'GetGameInstance->GetMirageClient'.

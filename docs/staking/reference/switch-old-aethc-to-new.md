# Switching aETHc on Binance

Part of Ankr Staking users who staked their ETH via Binance network in the [old StakeFi UI](https://stakefi.ankr.com/liquid-staking/ETH) got their aETHc locked when Binance stopped supporting the old Staking version.

If you are one of them, you can switch you old locked aETHc to the new aETHc, all on the BNB Chain.

1. In your wallet, switch the account with the locked aETHc and change the network option to Binance Smart Chain. 
2. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/). Ankr will ask you to connect your wallet if you haven't done it before.

3. Locate the "unsupported version" of aETHc and click **Switch to new**. <br />

   <p>If you forgot to change to Binance Smart Chain at Step 1, you may need to reconnect your wallet after changing to it.</p>

4. Confirm the switching transaction in your wallet. <br />

5. After confirming the transaction, wait for it to finalize. <br />

6. When the transaction is finalized and switching is successful, click **Go to dashboard** to see the new aETHc. <br />
   You can also  add it to your wallet clicking **Add aETHCc to wallet**. <br />

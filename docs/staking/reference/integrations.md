# Integrations

We encourage you to use Ankr Staking products in your projects. 

If you are a blockchain developer or a company, you may want to integrate with Ankr Staking and benefit from a ready-made solution.

Ankr Staking products are extensively tested, undergo [audit checks](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/reference/audit-reports) and have live users.<br /><br />

**Mechanics** pages give you general understanding of the workflow, requirements, fees, and so on.

**Development  details** give you a smart contracts API description, incl. functions, params, and live usage examples.

# Unstake ANKR token

### Before you start

:::note

Ensure you have a small amount of ETH for the gas fee.

ANKR delegated staking has a locking period of 84–91 days. You are only able to unstake ANKR or claim your rewards after this period has ended. The period applies to each of your staking transactions independently.

When unstaking, an undelegate period of 1 next epoch — 7 days — applies. After this period, you can claim your unstaked ANKR to the connected wallet address.
For example, if the epoch starts on Monday, and you unstaked on Monday, you'll wait 14 days (current_epoch + next_epoch), on Tuesday — 13 days, and so on.

## Unstake ANKR
We designed ANKR Staking with multiple Node Providers in mind, so there is no **Unstake all** button.
This button would be impossible with you staking with different Node Providers.
You can unstake your ANKR by specific staking transaction you made. 
:::note
Multiple Node Providers support is coming soon.

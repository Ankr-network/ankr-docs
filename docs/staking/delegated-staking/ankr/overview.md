# ANKR token (delegated) staking

## Introduction
ANKR token staking is similar to the idea of staking to help secure PoS networks. 
However, instead of delegating ANKR to validator nodes, ANKR token staking introduces the ability for anyone to stake to full nodes for the first time ever. 
Now, anyone can earn ANKR rewards and become an “_Ankr Bankr_” by staking their tokens with the independent full nodes running on our new decentralized Network.

## Why is ANKR token staking needed?
The Ankr Network depends on reliable, high-quality node providers to serve RPC requests on supported blockchains. 
As such, the system requires a significant deposit of ANKR backing each node provider. 
This includes ANKR deposits each node provider contributes (the self-stake) that is subject to slashing in the event of malicious acts or poor performance by the node provider.

In addition, token holders will have the ability to signal support for individual node providers on the Ankr Network by staking ANKR to back their nodes. 
By delegating ANKR to node providers, community members play an active role in discerning which service providers are reputable, performant, and worthy of a reputational boost. 
In return, ANKR token stakers share in the rewards earned by the node providers they support, while assuming a portion of slashing risks. 
ANKR staking will also enable delegators to allocate voting power to node providers to decide, among other things, which independent node providers will be admitted in the near term to service traffic on Ankr Network.  

Although the ANKR staking pool may eventually be capped in size, offering allotments to existing node providers, community members, and other active Ankr ecosystem members, the initial ANKR staking pool will not be capped in size, and we anticipate that the pool size will be expanded. 
This may cause the APY for the V1 of ANKR staking to be variable. 

## The benefits of staking ANKR
* **Experience a new kind of staking**<br />
  For the first time, you can stake your tokens to full nodes (serving the development layer) instead of validator nodes (serving the consensus layer).
* **Earn ANKR for enabling Web3 development**<br />
  Stakers help node providers operate on Ankr Network so they can serve the Web3 developers and applications depending on them for blockchain access. 
* **Boost Web3 integration and adoption**<br />
  Become part of a Network that provides developers faster and more reliable connections to blockchains so their decentralized applications can work more efficiently. 
* **Own & govern a foundational layer of Web3**<br />
  Those who stake ANKR can participate in the Ankr DAO to make critical decisions affecting the Network's future.

## What is next with ANKR token staking?
As Ankr continues to release more and more infrastructure solutions powered by Ankr Network, we will have a growing need for Ankr Bankrs to help secure the system. 
And as Web 3 grows and we add an ever-increasing number of chains to the protocol, Ankr will match the pace of Web3 adoption. Here’s what you can expect in the works:

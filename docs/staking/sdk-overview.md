# Overview

We are ready to provide our services to projects that need infrastructure as a service.

If you want to offer your users a scalable and ready-to-use staking solution, use our SDK to integrate Ankr Staking into your project.

## Difference between API and SDK
Our [API](https://ankr.com/docs/staking/api-overview) and SDK are overlapping each other. 

We recommend you use SDK over the API for easier integration, unless you need something specific that only the API can provide, such as Ankr Price Oracles.

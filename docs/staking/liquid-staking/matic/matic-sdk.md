# MATIC Liquid Staking SDK aka PolygonSDK

Integrating with Ankr Liquid Staking on Polygon has become easier. 

Now you can skip the complications of Solidity and learning how to send direct calls to [MATIC Liquid Staking API](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/matic/api/). 
Instead, use PolygonSDK — an npm package with compound and comprehensible JS methods that take care of all the low-level logic for you.

PolygonSDK allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, aMATICb/aMATICc tokens, and Polygon Liquid Staking contracts.

To start using it, install the [SDK npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/staking-sdk) and see the [PolygonSDK documentation](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/sdk/classes/PolygonSDK.html).

### How can I set up my wallet and stake MATIC?

Check the [Stake MATIC](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/matic/stake-matic) user guide.


### What is the minimum amount of MATIC I can stake?
 
1 MATIC.


### Is there a maximum amount I can stake?

No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited.  


### What is the unbonding period for aMATICb/aMATICc?

80 epochs and more depending on the network congestion. Typically, it takes around 1–2 days to receive your unstaked MATIC.


### How do I receive rewards? 

aMATICb is a rebasing token. When holding aMATICb, your balance will increase in proportion to your MATIC staking rewards. 
A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. 
So each day, you will see the quantity of your aMATICb increase by a small amount. 

aMATICc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. 
Instead, it appreciates in value, as the redemption ratio grows because of reward accumulation.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

aMATICb rewards arrive in your wallet with every rebase. Rebasing occurs daily. 

aMATICc rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as aMATICc grows in value to MATIC.

### Does Ankr charge for the service?

When unstaking, the user pays a fee in ANKR that starts from 100 ANKR. Typical fee range is 500–3500 ANKR.


### What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aMATICb?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much MATIC is validated on the network. 
Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.
 

### If I click **Unstake**, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?

Your stake **continues** to accumulate rewards until the moment you receive them.


### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. 
Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline.
The delegated staked MATIC is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. 
Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

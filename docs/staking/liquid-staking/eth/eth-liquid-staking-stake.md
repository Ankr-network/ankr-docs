2. Locate the **Ethereum (ETH)** box and click *Stake at old version* in it.

3. You are prompted to grant **Ankr Staking** access to your wallet. Click **Grant Access** to proceed.

## Stake your ETH

:::note
Make sure you have enough ETH to cover the gas fees for you transactions.

Also, remember that Ethereum currently doesn't support unstaking. You will only be able to unstake with the [Shanghai upgrade](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#misconceptions) which is planned for ~Q2/Q3 2023.

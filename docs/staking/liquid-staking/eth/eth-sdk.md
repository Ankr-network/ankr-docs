# ETH Liquid Staking SDK aka EthereumSDK

Integrating with Ankr Liquid Staking on Ethereum has become easier. 

Now you can skip the complications of Solidity and learning how to send direct calls to [ETH Liquid Staking API](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/api/). 
Instead, use EthereumSDK â€” an npm package with compound and comprehensible JS methods that take care of all the low-level logic in for you.

EthereumSDK allows you to interact with Ethereum blockchain, aETHb/aETHc tokens, and EthereumPool contracts.

To start using it, install the [SDK npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/staking-sdk) and see the [EthereumSDK documentation](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/sdk/classes/EthereumSDK.html).

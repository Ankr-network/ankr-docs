# FTM Liquid Staking SDK aka FantomSDK

Integrating with Ankr Liquid Staking on Fantom has become easier. 

Now you can skip the complications of Solidity and learning how to send direct calls to [FTM Liquid Staking API](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/ftm/api/). 
Instead, use FantomSDK â€” an npm package with compound and comprehensible JS methods that take care of all the low-level logic for you.

FantomSDK allows you to interact with the Fantom blockchain, aFTMb/aFTMc tokens, and Fantom Liquid Staking contracts.

To start using it, install the [SDK npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/staking-sdk) and see the [FantomSDK documentation](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/sdk/classes/FantomSDK.html).

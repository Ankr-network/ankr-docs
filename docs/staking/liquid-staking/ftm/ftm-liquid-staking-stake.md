Your aFTMb balance automatically increases by a small amount, daily, to reflect your Fantom Staking rewards, while your aFTMc amount never changes but grows in value to FTM overtime.  

You can now use your aFTMb reward earning tokens to earn additional layers of rewards on other DeFi platforms listed in [**DeFi**](https://ankr.com/staking/defi/) under the aFTMb section.

If you don't see the balance in your wallet, add the token manually:

1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard).
2. Find your liquid staking token, click the three-dot menu, and click **Copy token address**.
3. Insert the token address directly into your wallet (e.g. MetaMask).

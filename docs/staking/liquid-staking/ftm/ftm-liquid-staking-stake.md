Your aFTMb balance automatically increases by a small amount, daily, to reflect your Fantom Staking rewards. You can now use your aFTMb reward earning tokens to earn additional layers of rewards on other DeFi platforms listed in [**DeFi**](https://ankr.com/staking/defi/) under the aFTMb section.

If you don't see the balance in your wallet, do the following:

1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard).
2. Find your liquid staking token, click the three-dot menu, and click **Copy token address**.
3. Insert the token address directly into your wallet (e.g. MetaMask).

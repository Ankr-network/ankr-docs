## Overview
 
:::info Before you start

Ensure you have a small amount of BNB for the gas fee.

Unstaking BNB tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the BNB smart-contracts deployed in Binance chain and BNB Chain.

BNB tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

## Unstake BNB

:::warning release time and fees

Unbond time for your stake is to 7-14 days, so you will receive the funds 7-14 after you unstaked.

This is due to the Binance Chain unbond time, which is 7 days for 1 validator.  
Additional 7 days are because once a user unstaked with a validator, other users have to wait these 7 days + their 7 days period. 

Also, ensure you have a small amount of BNB to pay the Binance gas fee for the unstake transaction.

# BNB Liquid Staking SDK aka BinanceSDK

Integrating with Ankr Liquid Staking on Binance has become easier. 

Now you can skip the complications of Solidity and learning how to send direct calls to [BNB Liquid Staking API](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/bnb/api/). 
Instead, use BinanceSDK â€” a npm package with compound and comprehensible JS methods that take care of all the low-level logic in a flow.

BinanceSDK allows you to interact with Binance blockchain, aBNBb/aBNBc tokens and BinancePool contracts.

To start using it, install the [SDK npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/staking-sdk) and see the [BinanceSDK documentation](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/sdk/classes/BinanceSDK.html).

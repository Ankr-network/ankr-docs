# Avalanche Liquid Staking

Ankr Staking offers Avalanche token holders the opportunity to stake AVAX and in return claim Ankr Avalanche Liquid Staking tokens — aAVAXb and aAVAXc.

* aAVAXb is a reward-earning token, meaning that rewards from AVAX staking will be distributed daily through rebasing and aAVAXb holders' balance in their wallet will increase on a daily basis.
* aAVAXc is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 aAVAXc token vs. AVAX increases over time as staking rewards accumulate. 

### 1. Market liquidity

aAVAXb is tradable on the following Decentralized Exchanges on Avalanche network:

* [**Pangolin**](https://pangolin.exchange)
* [**Lydia Finance**](https://www.lydia.finance)

aAVAXc is tradable in [Ankr DeFi](https://ankr.com/defi/trade/).

### 2. Unstaking

From the Ankr Staking dashboard, you can choose to **Unstake** and redeem aAVAXb/aAVAXc. 
Wait for up to 28 days to redeem aAVAXb/aAVAXc for AVAX. 

:::info
Unstaking means that aAVAXb has an **elastic supply** contributing to a **robust price stability mechanism** without relying on having large amounts of tokens in liquidity pools to ensure token price stability.

### 3. Access **Instant Liquidity Pools** 

* Ankr token holders can soon gain access to instant liquidity pools. This allows them to sell 1 aAVAXb against 1 AVAX instantly and subject to the instant liquidity pool capacity. 

* 3% of the allocated AVAX tokens to Ankr Staking will not be staked and will remain unstaked.

* aAVAXb/aAVAXc holders indirectly bear the cost of the instant liquidity pool, which will represent 3% of the staking rewards due to the missed opportunity to stake AVAX. Therefore, the total cost for aAVAXb/aAVAXc holders will be 2% service fee, plus 3% missed opportunity to stake AVAX, which equals 4.94% (no service fee applied to 3% instant liquidity pool).

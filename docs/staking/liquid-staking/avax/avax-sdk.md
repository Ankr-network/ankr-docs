# AVAX Liquid Staking SDK aka AvalancheSDK

Integrating with Ankr Liquid Staking on Avalanche has become easier. 

Now you can skip the complications of Solidity and learning how to send direct calls to [AVAX Liquid Staking API](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/avax/api/). 
Instead, use AvalancheSDK â€” an npm package with compound and comprehensible JS methods that take care of all the low-level logic for you.

AvalancheSDK allows you to interact with the Avalanche blockchain, aAVAXb/aAVAXc tokens, and Avalanche Liquid Staking contracts.

To start using it, install the [SDK npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/staking-sdk) and see the [AvalancheSDK documentation](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/sdk/classes/AvalancheSDK.html).

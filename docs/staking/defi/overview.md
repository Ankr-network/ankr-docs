# Ankr DeFi 

## What is Ankr DeFi?

Ankr DeFi Trade is a Liquid Staking data aggregation tool providing access to real-time trading prices.

It allows users to find all liquidity staking DeFi integrations to trade between Liquid Staking tokens and other assets.

Liquid Staking tokens, e.g. aETHc or aMATICb, are tokens users get when staking their assets, e.g. ETH or MATIC, in Ankr Staking. 

## Ankr DeFi Dashboard 
Ankr DeFi features a cross-chain dashboard where users can choose Liquid Staking tokens and assets to trade, and platforms to trade on.

Currently, the dashboard features:
* [Liquidity pools](/staking/defi/liquidity-pools)
* [Yield farming](/staking/defi/yield-farming)
* [Vaults](/staking/defi/vaults)

Borrowing and Indexes are coming later.

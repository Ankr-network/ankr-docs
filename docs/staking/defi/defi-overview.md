# Ankr DeFi 

## What is Ankr DeFi?

Ankr DeFi Trade is a Liquid Staking data aggregation tool providing access to real-time trading prices.

It allows users to find all liquidity staking DeFi integrations to trade between Liquid Staking tokens and other assets.

Liquid Staking tokens, e.g. aETHc or aMATICb, are tokens users get when staking their assets, e.g. ETH or MATIC, in Ankr Staking. 

## Ankr DeFi Dashboard 
Ankr DeFi features a cross-chain dashboard where users can choose Liquid Staking tokens and assets to trade, and platforms to trade on.

Currently, the dashboard features:
* Liquidity pools
* Yield farming
* Vaults

Borrowing and Indexes are coming later.

## Liquidity pools
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see dashboard where you can enable the **Liquidity pool** filter. 

This filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit providing liquidity on DEXs and getting a % of the swapping commissions when users swap their tokens using the pool.

Liquidity pairs in the listed liquidity pools usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token.

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a pool:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the pool.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity
To withdraw liquidity from a pool:
1. On the page of the pool, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

## Yield farming
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see dashboard where you can enable the **Farming** filter. 

This filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit providing liquidity on DEXs and getting rewards in the LP tokens which you can then farm.

Liquidity pairs in the listed yield farming pools usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token.
Rewards are usually given in the LP token native to the DEX (e.g. CAKE for PancakeSwap).

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a pool:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the pool.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, choose a pool if there are multiple pools listed, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity
To withdraw liquidity from a pool:
1. On the page of the pool, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

### Yield farm
To yield farm your LP tokens:
1. On the page of the pool, claim your rewards â€” the liquid pool tokens rewarded you for providing liquidity to the pool (usually, via a dedicated **Rewards** tab). 
2. Stake your LP tokens and gain yield (usually, via the **Stake** button on a dedicated **Stake LP** tab or **Deposit & Stake** button on the main pool page).  

### Withdraw yield-farming rewards
To withdraw your LP tokens along with the yield gains:
1. On the page of the pool, withdraw your LP tokens (usually, via the **Withdraw** button on a dedicated **Stake LP** tab or **Withdraw** button on the main pool page).

## Vaults
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see dashboard where you can enable the **Vault** filter. 

This filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit providing liquidity on DEXs and autofarming it via vaults.

Liquidity pairs in the listed vaults usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token.
Rewards can be given either in the tokens deposited to the pool (e.g. ETH/aETHc) or sometimes the LP token native to the DEX (e.g. CAKE for PancakeSwap). 

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a vault:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the vault.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, choose a vault if there are multiple vaults listed, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity and rewards
To withdraw liquidity and/or rewards from a vault:
1. On the page of the vault, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

# Understanding token standards 

## ERC-721

The standard for non-fungible tokens, often used for collectibles and games.
This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the [ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

## ERC-1155

A novel standard for multi-tokens, allowing for a single contract to represent multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens, along with batched operations for increased gas efficiency. [ERC1155 Multi Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).

## Introduction
Ankr Staking is designed to support Proof-of-Stake networks whilst offering improved benefits to traditional staking.

Ankr was the first project to pioneer liquid staking tokens on staked ETH in December 2020. The key motivation was to solve the liquidity problem inherent to staking. Once ETH is staked on the ETH beacon project it is effectively locked and unobtainable until the merger of the beacon chain with the main chain. 

These staked assets lose the ability to:
* be borrowed against
* to power liquidity in DeFi applications alongside stablecoins. 

## Ankr Staking
Ankr Staking offers two key benefits to participants:

1. We enable any DeFi user to easily access staking rewards from multiple blockchain protocols without needing any technical expertise.

2. We offer a range of products to innovative solutions solving an inherent problem of Proof-of-Stake blockchains - capital inefficiency

## The Ankr Protocol 
Our new protocol allows anyone in the world to participate in providing nodes and earn ANKR as a reward for their services. This allows them to “Ankr” their node to our network and join a decentralized community and economy.

## Public Community RPC
One of the cornerstones of the Ankr Vision is mass adoption in Web 3.0 and the crypto economy. 
A Public Community RPC is central to this vision.
 
### Permissionless, Open Access
* Public RPC endpoints are available to all at zero cost.
* They are not rate-limited. 
* No username or password is required. 

### Enables Interoperability
* Use of our public RPC services enables easy interoperability with other open-source software. You can use services like MetaMask to connect with data on Ankr supported blockchains.

* The RPC enables frictionless, automatic interaction with blockchain data and the execution of tasks like crypto wallet transactions. 

### Simplified Development
* Developers can build dApps freely without payment, email signup, credit card, or any other KYC information.  
* Standardization of queries.
There are many ways to query a node via an API endpoint. Responses from queries are not always as expected. Querying Public RPC nodes returns the exact response you would expect to see when running a full node yourself.

## Multi-Chain RPC
* Easy connection to multiple chains.

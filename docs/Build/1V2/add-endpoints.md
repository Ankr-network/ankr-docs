title: Add your own endpoints

Premium Plan (v2) users now have the ability to add external RPC endpoints to their account e.g. Infura endpoint. These RPC endpoints serve as an additional resource for your own traffic ONLY. 

Ankr can also support your specific use case to create a custom node cluster. You can then add an endpoint from this to your account. 

## Key advantages

Move towards greater decentralization and away from the risk of a single-point-of-failure.

1. Added RPC endpoints are secure and private. There is no possibility of no data mining. 

2. You can utilize credit from other providers e.g. Infura or Alchemy to create new endpoints and multiple paths to nodes.  

3. Add an endpoint from your own node. For example, a node configured for a specific purpose e.g. archive data, mainnet forking


## How does it work?

### 01 Obtain additional endpoint

You can add an RPC endpoint from:

1. Other providers e.g. Infura, 
2. A private endpoint from your own node running on your machine.
3. An endpoint from a specially configured node cluster. (Contact [sales@ankr.com] to discuss your use case).

### 02 Add your endpoint

1. From [Ankr Protocol](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/public/) select **Premium Plan**

2. Select the Chain you want to add your endpoints to.

3. Add your Endpoint to the 'My endpoints' section and click '*+ Add Endpoint*'. Add further endpoint URLs as desired.

Premium Plan (v2) users now have the ability to add external RPC endpoints to their account e.g. Infura endpoint. These RPC endpoints serve as an additional resource for your own traffic ONLY. 

Ankr can also provide an RPC endpoint for a Custom Configuration Node Cluster to support your specific use case. 

## Advantages

1. Added RPC endpoints are secure and private (no data mining)

2. You can utilize credit from other providers e.g. Infura or Alchemy to create new endpoints.

3. Add an endpoint from a node configured for a specific use case e.g. archive data, mainnet forking



## How does it work?

You can add an RPC endpoint from:

1. Another provider e.g. Infura, 
2. A Private Endpoint from your own machine

1. From [Ankr Protocol](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/public/) select Premium Plan

2. Open the Chain you want to add your endpoints to.

3. Add your Endpoint to the 'My endpoints' section and click '*+ Add Endpoint*'. Add further endpoint URLs as desired.






## Highlights

* This feature is included in your Premium Plan (10k ANKR)
* No KYC required
* No staking required. (No rewards are available)

## Requirements

1. **Functioning RPC Endpoints**
- Only fully functioning RPC endpoints can be added.
- The end-user must test the endpoint via the UI prior to adding it. 

2. **Whitelisting**
- Access must be restricted by whitelisting IPs/Referrer URLs

# Near

# Near RPC
NEAR is a decentralized, development platform built on a [sharded](https://near.org/downloads/Nightshade.pdf), Proof-of-Stake, Layer 1 blockchain designed for ease of use.

NEAR developers can host serverless applications and smart contracts that easily connect to "open finance" networks and benefit from an ecosystem of "open web"  components.

:::warning
Near is not compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  All contract code is deployed and run inside a WASM Compatible Virtual Machine.

# Connect Wallet

The NEAR Protocol has its own NEAR Wallet. This is an in-browser, web-based wallet for creating and interacting with NEAR accounts.&#x20;

[Near Wallet Docs](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-wallet)

**Rainbow Bridge** allows the migration of ETH assets to the NEAR platform.&#x20;

Ethereum users can onboard to NEAR using the [ETH Faucet](https://faucet.paras.id), hosted by Paras, and MetaMask.&#x20;

Users must login to MetaMask and prove that their account has a balance higher than 0.05 ETH to  claim a NEAR account and start using the [**Rainbow Bridge**](https://near.org/bridge/#:\~:text=Simply%20by%20logging%20into%20MetaMask,the%20Rainbow%20Bridge%20right%20away.).

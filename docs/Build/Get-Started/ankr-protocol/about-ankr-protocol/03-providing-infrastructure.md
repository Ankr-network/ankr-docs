# 03 Providing Infrastructure

Being a Provider on Ankr Protocol is the ultimate mutually beneficial relationship. You can literally “Ankr” your node(s) to the network and enhance infrastructure capacity for yourself and other network participants.&#x20;

At times when your own nodes are overstretched, you can benefit from utilizing the services of the network to add capacity to meet your own demands. In this way you can both Build & Earn.

### Flexible Scaling on Demand

Ankr allows you to expand and scale your infrastructure without risk and convert a capital expense into an operational expense. This allows you to free up resources to focus on revenue generation activities.

With Ankr Protocol you get two fold benefits:

1. You can send traffic to our ultra fast and reliable Multi RPC network at times of peak demand in a pay as you go model.&#x20;
2. Your own node infrastructure can be used by others at times of low demand. Earn rewards for providing.&#x20;

With ANKR there is no requirement to invest in additional node infrastructure any more.

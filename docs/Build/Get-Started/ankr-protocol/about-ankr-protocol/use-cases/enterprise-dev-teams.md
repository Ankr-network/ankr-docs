### _**01 Convert your capital expenditure into operational expenditure**_

To ensure you can meet peak demands, the tendency is to expand infrastructure and significantly increase  fixed costs.

Whilst this allows you to meet demands at peak times, it also means that your expensive infrastructure sits idle at times of normal or low demand.

Ankr allows you to expand and scale your infrastructure without risk and convert a capital expense into an operational expense. This allows you to free up resources to focus on revenue generation activities.

#### BENEFITS:

#### **1. You can send traffic to our ultra fast and reliable Multi RPC network at times of peak demand in a pay as you go model. **

**2. You can add your own node infrastructure to the Multi RPC network and allow others to use your idle capacity at times of low demand for you. You can earn rewards for doing so.**

With ANKR there is no requirement to invest in additional node infrastructure any more.

### _**02 Ensure private transactions for you and your customers**_

Create your own private API connections to ensure important transactions can be conducted without risk of front running.&#x20;

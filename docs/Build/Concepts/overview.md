# Build - Overview

**Ankr Build** provides a truly distributed, multi-chain infrastructure network and toolkit to simplify the building of applications.

### What is the difference between Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Networks?

A Network is a set of nodes and a set of edges, or interconnections between nodes. This means that it is possible to have a network that is made up of several islands of nodes, where no connections exist between nodes on different islands. These islands are called **Components**.

In general, there are three primary network architectures. **Centralized**, **Distributed** and **Decentralized**.

<h3>Centralized Network</h3>
In a Centralized Network, there is a central network owner connecting all the other users and devices. This creates a single point of failure. For example, private blockchains run on servers controlled by a single organization. The central authority determines who can run a node. 

### Decentralized Network
Decentralized networks are built from a hierarchy of nodes. There is no central network owner and control is spread across independent entities. However, if you look at the diagram above, you can see that nodes at the bottom of the hierarchy have only a single connection to the network. This means that failure of a few nodes in a decentralized network leaves several connected components of nodes able to communicate with each other (but not with nodes in a different component or island).  

:::tip Key point
Centralized and Decentralized networks are concerned with control of the network.

### Distributed Network
Though often used as synonyms, **Decentralized** and **Distributed** networks are not the same. 

A Distributed Network refers to the physical distribution of nodes. 

Every node has roughly the same number of edges or interconnections, and there are multiple routes in which nodes can connect with each other. 

A non-distributed system resides in a single location, whereas a distributed system resides in multiple physical locations. 

Networks that are more distributed tend to be more resilient to the failure of individual nodes or loss of connection between them. 

:::tip Key point
A Distributed Network is about the Physical distribution of nodes. Control is a separate concern. Therefore, a Distributed Network can be either Centralized or Decentralized.

**The optimum Web3 infrastructure is both Distributed AND Decentralized**

### Web3 Infrastructure and back door centralization 

The key premise of Web3 is decentralization. 

Decentralization is the central ethos of blockchain technology and drives projects across the ecosystem.
However, the vast majority of node infrastructure is relying heavily on Cloud Service Providers such as Google or AWS. This includes most Node as a Service providers such as Alchemy and Infura.

The biggest concern with centralized data storage models is that users are required to place trust in the central authority of the provider.




 to keep their data safe, keep websites online, and not tamper with or censor the content that the centralized data providers host. Centralized cloud servers can provide a lot of computing power, but they may also provide a target for nation-states or attackers looking to disrupt the network.

Cloud service providers allow developers to launch their applications more quickly, without worrying about setting up and managing servers, but customers typically have limited options in terms of providers and functionality. The majority of cloud storage providers are subsidiaries of bonafide tech giants and dominate the cloud services market, accounting for about 70% of the total market share as of 2021.

Despite their popularity and widespread use, many centralized cloud storage providers have been criticized for their tendency to force end users into inflexible and expensive cloud services and storage plans due to a lack of viable alternatives. Studies have shown that many developers settle for fixed amounts of hosting space that remain underutilized. This often results in hefty — and in many cases, unnecessary — premiums paid for cloud services.

The using a node service you are centralizing the infrastructure aspect of your product. For this reason, projects that hold decentralization to the upmost importance might prefer self-hosting nodes rather than outsourcing to a 3rd party.

three primary network architectures are typically considered: centralized, distributed, and decentralized. While blockchain technologies often make use of decentralized networks, a blockchain application itself cannot be categorized simply as being decentralized or not. Rather, decentralization is a sliding scale and should be applied to all aspects of a blockchain application. By decentralizing the management of and access to resources in an application, greater and fairer service can be achieved. Decentralization typically has some tradeoffs such as lower transaction throughput, but ideally, the tradeoffs are worth the improved stability and service levels they produce.


, whereas distribution refers to physical location. In
a centralized system, control is handled by a single entity,
but in a decentralized system control is handled by diferent independent entities. A non-distributed system resides 
in a single location, whereas distributed system resides in
multiple physical locations. A distributed system can either
be centralized or decentralized. Public blockchains like Bitcoin
and Ethereum are examples of distributed and decentralized
systems. Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain systems cannot
be altered by a single entity, thus making it’s control decentralized, as well as blockchain data replicated and shared
on a peer-to-peer network of independent nodes in d

### What's different about Ankr Build compared to other infrastructure providers e.g. Infura, Alchemy


### How?




### Ankr Protocol
The (r)evolutionary Ankr protocol brings increasing definition to Ankr’s vision of Web 3.0 mass adoption. Ankr Protocol provides reliable, load balanced access to geographically distributed node clusters you can access from anywhere in the world.
Ankr Protocol features: 
- Open access to a Public RPC API layer - Just grab the endpoint and start making calls straightaway. No sign-up needed.
- Exclusive https and wss endpoints and other benefits with Premium Plan - 
- Flexible Node Providing options 

### Ankr Scan
Ankr Scan is a Multi-Chain Explorer allowing to view assets across chains as well as assigned to a specific wallet address.  

### API Services (v1)
- Free Tier with scaling as you go.
- 45+ EVM-compatible blockchains
- Enterprise-grade connectivity.

### Node Services (v1)
Full/Archive and Validator/Staking nodes are available for 50+ chains.

is designed to make it easy for anyone to join the Web3 movement and start building truly decentralized applications. 

Connecting an application to the blockchain is essential to make transactions, 

A real barrier to entering this space is navigating the technical complexity and cost of running blockchain infrastructure. Setting up a blockchain node yourself requires technical experience, specialized hardware, and regular maintenance. There are a number of risks to running your own node.

 - There can be penalties if the uptime of your node is interrupted.

 - Internet outages can result in missed transactions and slashing events.

 - Managing node maintenance alongside ensuring constant uptime without loss of data. 

 - Risk of losing keys or damaging hardware that store keys.

 - Malicious attack. 

The Ankr Build product suite provides simplified access to reliable Web3 infrastructure so you can focus on unleashing your creativity to build. 







For example:

# Overview

More and more businesses and consumers are seeking opportunities to adapt and innovate with Web 3.0 blockchain technology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead involved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure often act as a barrier.

Ankr is committed to simplifying developer access to Web 3.0 and Decentralized Finance. 

We make it super easy to connect via our **Public RPC Chains** without even needing to sign up with Ankr. Additional plans are available as you scale. 

Our Public RPC Chains are part of the Multi Chain Network that underpins **Ankr Protocol**. The Ankr Protocol provides reliable, load balanced access to node clusters from anywhere in the world. As you scale, our premium plan offers an exclusive RPC API endpoint as well as an exclusive Websocket wss endpoint. 

You also have the opportunity to participate in the Ankr Protocol as a **Provider**. Providers benefit from the ability to send traffic to our ultra fast and reliable Multi RPC network at times of peak demand in a pay as you go model. Additionally, you can add your own node infrastructure to the Multi RPC network and allow others to use your idle capacity at times of low demand for you. You can earn rewards for doing so.





## Chain Neutrality

### We are Chain Neutral
Ankr is a single platform that provides multiple different chains without advocating for any particular chain over another.

This is also known as Blockchain Agnosticism.

As a multi-chain provider, Ankr is chain neutral; we don’t advocate for our users to adopt any particular chain in preference to another. For example, a question we often get from developers is “Should I build my project on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain?”. We leave this to you.

Developers currently have to choose between the networks and ecosystem.

One consideration might be whether they want users to hold crypto assets on ETH (ERC20) or BSC (BEP20) and what the implications are. For example, a user holding USDT, the ERC20 version, cannot easily buy a NFT being sold with USDT, the BEP20 version.

Ankr is at the forefront of addressing these limitations. By working closely with developers, Ankr has pioneered the building of tools for cross-chain interoperability.

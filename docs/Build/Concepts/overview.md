is designed to make it easy for anyone to join the Web3 movement and start building truly decentralized applications. 

Connecting an application to the blockchain is essential to make transactions, 

A real barrier to entering this space is navigating the technical complexity and cost of running blockchain infrastructure. Setting up a blockchain node yourself requires technical experience, specialized hardware, and regular maintenance. There are a number of risks to running your own node.

 - There can be penalties if the uptime of your node is interrupted.

 - Internet outages can result in missed transactions and slashing events.

 - Managing node maintenance alongside ensuring constant uptime without loss of data. 

 - Risk of losing keys or damaging hardware that store keys.

 - Malicious attack. 

The Ankr Build product suite provides simplified access to reliable Web3 infrastructure so you can focus on unleashing your creativity to build.

Ankr Products remove this complexity and simplify access to Web 3.0.

:::success Fast, Secure, Node Access
1. Get an **RPC endpoint** immediately.
We make it super easy to connect to networks including Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom and a growing number of chains with free Public RPC endpoints. Additional **Premium** plans are available as you scale with an exclusive RPC API endpoint as well as an exclusive Websocket wss endpoint. 

2. Fully **decentralized multi-chain network**
These public RPC Chains are part of the multi-chain network that underpins **Ankr Protocol**. The Ankr Protocol provides truly decentralized reliable and load balanced access to node clusters from anywhere in the world. 

3. Join the **Ankr Provider Program**.
You also have the opportunity to participate in the Ankr Protocol as part of our **Provider Program**. Providers can add their own node infrastructure to the multi-chain network and earn rewards for doing so. Providers will also be able to send traffic to our ultra fast and reliable multi-chain network at times of peak demand in a pay as you go model.

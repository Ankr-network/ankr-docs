# The Ankr Approach

## We are Chain Neutral

Ankr is a single platform that provides multiple different chains without advocating for any particular chain over another.

NOTE: This is also known as Blockchain Agnosticism.

As a multi-chain provider, Ankr is chain neutral; we don’t advocate for our users to adopt any particular chain in preference to another. 

Ankr users have to choose between networks and the ecosystem. 
One consideration is whether they want users to hold crypto assets on ETH (ERC20) or BSC (BEP20) and what the implications are. A user holding USDT - the ERC20 version - cannot easily buy a NFT being sold with USDT, the BEP20 version.

Ankr is at the forefront of addressing these limitations. By working closely with developers, Ankr has pioneered the building of tools for cross-chain interoperability.

## We are committed to Full Decentralization

Decentralization is a corner stone of Ankr's purpose.

It is the heart and driving force of Ankr. 

Ankr has launched over 15,000 nodes globally that support a thriving ecosystem of over 50 Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This infrastructure is fundamental to the provision of tools for a rapidly growing community of Web 3.0 developers. 

Through cloud computing, Ankr links together servers to create on-demand resources for those building decentralized apps, protocols, and smart contracts that contribute to a more connected and democratized version of the web. 

Ankr’s startup idea (and first whitepaper) sought to use idle processing power in data centers to build an open-source cloud called the DCCN or “distributed cloud computing network”. In this initial model, a user could run any application on the ANKR decentralized cloud service. 

Since then, Ankr has evolved to focus exclusively on serving the crypto economy with decentralized access to nodes for multiple use cases.

* Our nodes are distributed across ***independent third party data centers*** across multiple geographic locations.

* We ***never use centralized public cloud providers*** — other API providers typically use a centralized service like AWS. 

* As a crypto and blockchain native company, Ankr is **self-funded**. We are not beholden to investors, ***we are completely driven by our community***. This is paramount to avoiding the domination of a few players. 

* The Community owns and secures the service.

## We are on a path towards being a DAO.

Ankr is on a solid pathway towards being governed by its community through the ANKR DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Institutional investors will not be allowed to buy up the majority of tokens, hence ensuring the community is in power. 


## Web 3.0

Web 3.0 - The Next Generation of Internet
Mass adoption of Web 3.0 by individuals, developers and enterprises is key to securing the next stage of the internet.
The third generation of the internet is here but still under construction. The Web 3.0 movement refers to the building of an internet of decentralized networks that no single entity controls. It is a movement away from the centralized corporations that currently dominate the web and profit from the data users generate.

The key innovation of these networks is the creation of platforms that no single entity controls, yet everyone can still trust. The more participation on these networks - the greater the security for everybody.

Blockchain technology underlies the decentralization that is essential to the formation of Web 3.0 because it is open, trustless and permissionless. Decentralization and the enablement of value transfers between peers are the key building blocks of Web 3.0.

Ankr provides Web 3.0 infrastructure for individuals, developers, and enterprises.

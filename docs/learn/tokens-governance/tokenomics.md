# Tokenomics

## Tokenomics
There is no inflation built into the ANKR token. For example, a user who owns 1,000,000 ANKR, would own 0.0001% of te total supply. Because there is no inflation, that user’s percentage of the total supply would not change over time.

## Circulating supply
Circulating supply refers to the amount of Ankr tokens available for use in the open market. Ankr plans to release the remaining supply for distribution programs, developer grants, and to provide liquidity to future exchange listings. One hundred percent of the token supply is scheduled to be unlocked by August, 2022, though Ankr reserves the right to change this at any time for any reason.

**Initial token supply** — 40%.

**Unlocked token supply** — 60% (over 36 months between August 2019-August 2022).

For more detail, take a look at [**Ankr Token Distribution Smart Contract**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c2578bf9e37eb1d0ddf45a410723d95e554cbdd#code) from 2019-02-21.

## Why 10 billion tokens?

Ankr chose this amount so that our token holders would not have to do fractional math**!**

It’s estimated there are around 25 million developers in the world today. 
As adoption increases, it is possible that Ankr could bring 4%, or 1 million developers into the Web 3.0 movement. 
Hypothetically, if the ANKR token was evenly distributed, 1 million developers could hold a maximum of 10,000 tokens each. 
This allows us to better utilize the token in whole numbers.

## Burned tokens

Approximately 2% of Ankr tokens [have been burned](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8290333cef9e6d528dd5618fb97a76f268f3edd4?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead). At this time, we are unlikely to burn more as it does not fit in with our long term strategy.

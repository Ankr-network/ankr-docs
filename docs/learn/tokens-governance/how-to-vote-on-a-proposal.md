# How to vote

How to participate in a vote:

1. Connect a supported private wallet (such as MetaMask) to the Ankr platform and grant permission to the Governance Deposit contract.

2. Tokens sent to this contract are locked for voting purposes. They are unlocked after all votes that the tokens are participating in have ended.

3. As the vote progresses, live results are visible on the Governance dashboard where users can see the result as it unfolds!

4. When voting ends, the result is published and if successful, conveyed to the Ankr team for implementation. For simple parameter changes to the contract, this could be a matter of days, or for something more complex, a longer time frame is likely.

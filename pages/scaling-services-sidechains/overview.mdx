# Sidechains as a service

## What is a sidechain?
A sidechain is a separate blockchain that stems from the parent blockchain (mainnet) and runs independent, in parallel to it.
A sidechain is commonly attached to the parent blockchain by a two-way bridge â€” this enables the interchangeability of digital assets between the parent and the sidechain.

## What is Sidechains as a service?
Sidechains as a service is a SAAS framework for creating sidechains in different ecosystems. This framework provides an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their own blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with one of the corresponding supported mainnets.

The main purpose of Ankr Sidechains is to allow any developer to raise their blockchain in a matter of hours, with its unique specifications and validator set.  A sidechain can be connected to the corresponding mainnet infrastructure.

## What blockchains are supported?
Sidechains as a service currently support:
* Avalanche
* Binance
* Polygon

This means you can address us to create a sidechain on any of those blockchains, and your sidechain will be ready to connect to the mainnet.

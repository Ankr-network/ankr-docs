# What are Sidechains

A sidechain is a separate blockchain that stems from the parent blockchain (Mainnet) and runs independent, in parallel to it.
A sidechain is commonly attached to the parent blockchain by a two-way bridge â€” this enables the interchangeability of digital assets between the parent and the sidechain.

## What is Sidechains-as-a-service

Sidechains-as-a-service is a framework for creating sidechain products in various ecosystems employing Ankr's ready-to-use components. This framework provides an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their own blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with one of the applicable Mainnets.

The main purpose of Ankr Sidechains is to allow any developer to raise their blockchain in a matter of hours, with its unique specifications and validator sets. A sidechain can be connected to the corresponding Mainnet infrastructure.

## Ecosystems supported

For the Sidechain solutions, we support the following ecosystems:

  * **Avalanche**

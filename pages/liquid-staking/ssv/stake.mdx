# Stake ETH in SSV–Ethereum

## Before you start
Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a [MetaMask wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed and set up in Chrome.

## Get Testnet ETH
As SSV Trustless Liquid Staking is currently available on Ethereum Goerli, you'll be staking Testnet tokens.

As Goerli is a testing network, you can get Goerli ETH from a Goerli faucet, such as [Goerlifaucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).
More faucets can easily be found on Internet. 

## Connect your wallet
<Callout type="warning">

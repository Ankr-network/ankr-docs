# Unstake ETH

## Unstaking limitations
Currently, unstaking is not available, as this functionality is not yet supported by Ethereum.

Unstaking will be enabled after in the Shanghai upgrade that will follow The Merge in 6-12 months.

Overall, it looks like Shanghai is going to happen April 12, 2023.

From our side, Ankr plans to enable unstaking as soon as it's delivered by Ethereum.

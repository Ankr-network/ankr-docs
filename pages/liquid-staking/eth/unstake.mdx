# Unstake ETH
<Callout type="warning">
    Remember that the unstaking functionality is planned to come to Ethereum Mainnet on April 12, 2023. We're planning to release the unstaking ETH feature the same day, a couple of hours later. **You will only be able to unstake then.**
</Callout>

## Release time
Unstaking takes from 1 day and up. The exact time depends on the Ethereum unstaking queue and may take days or weeks.

    Once transaction is confirmed, Ankr Staking Dashboard updates to show **Unstaking in progress** at the token box.<br/>
    If you unstaked a big amount of FTM and didn't receive it in 35 days, it means your stake exceeds the current payout amount Ankr has.
    In this case, please create a [support request](https://ankrnetwork.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/10) and we'll resolve your issue shortly.

# Unstake ETH

## Unstake options
You have two options when unstaking:
1. Standard unstake — dynamic time depending on the Ethereum unstake queue. Currently, <UnstakeETHTimer />.
2. Flash unstake — instant release of your funds, 0.5% commission, and unstake limits dictated by the current capacity of the flash-unstake pool.

### Standard unstake
Standard unstake depends on the Ethereum unstake queue and currently, takes <UnstakeETHTimer /> until your funds are released to your wallet.

### Flash unstake
Flash unstake uses a pool to swap your Liquid Staking tokens for your original assets, which means instant release of your funds.

While it offers instant release of your funds, it poses a few limitations:
1. You have to pay a technical service fee for a flash unstake — 0.5% of the unstaked amount.
2. Your unstake is limited by the current capacity of the flash-unstake pool. If you exceed it, the interface switches to the standard unstake with its regular release time.

### Unstaking large amounts
Large amounts may be split when unstaked:
* With the flash unstake, the pool's capacity may not be sufficiently large at the moment of your unstake, and you'll be switched to the standard unstake interface.
* With standard unstake, it may be split into several parts, but all the parts that constitute the unstaked amount will be released to your account within the <UnstakeETHTimer /> days period.

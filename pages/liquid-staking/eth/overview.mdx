# Ethereum Liquid Staking

## What and why is Ethereum Liquid Staking?
Ankr Staking offers Ethereum token holders the opportunity to stake ETH and in return claim Ethereum Liquid Staking tokens â€” ankrETH (ex-aETHc). 
<Callout type="info">
There are no more new stakes getting aETHb token. However, old stakes with aETHb keep generating you rewards. You can also [switch aETHb for ankrETH now](https://www.ankr.com/staking/switch/) (supply is limited).
</Callout>
 
<Callout type="warning">
Currently, unstaking is not available, as this functionality is not yet supported by Ethereum.<br/>
Unstaking will be enabled after in the Shanghai upgrade that will follow The Merge in 6-12 months.<br/> 
Overall, it looks like Shanghai is going to come in ~Q2/Q3 2023.

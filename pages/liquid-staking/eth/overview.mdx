# Ethereum Liquid Staking

## What and why is Ethereum Liquid Staking?
Ankr Staking offers Ethereum token holders the opportunity to stake ETH and in return claim Ethereum Liquid Staking tokens â€” ankrETH (ex-aETHc). 
<Callout type="tip">
We have made a separate [testnet version of Liquid Staking on Goerli](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/)! <br/>
    Anybody interested to test our Liquid Staking without spending mainnet ETH, come and try it!<br/>
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
There are no more new stakes getting aETHb token. However, old stakes with aETHb keep generating you rewards. You can also [switch aETHb for ankrETH now](https://www.ankr.com/staking/switch/) (supply is limited).

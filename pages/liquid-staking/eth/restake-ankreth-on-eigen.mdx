# Restake ankrETH on EigenLayer

Once you have staked ETH in Ethereum Liquid Staking, you have an opportunity to restake it on EigenLayer.
<Callout type="info">
  Currently, EigenLayer only offers restaking on Goerli Testnet. <br/>
    If you want to test restaking, please [get goETH](staking-extra/get-goerli-eth/) and stake it in the [testnet version of Ethereum Liquid Staking on Goerli](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/).
    Then proceed with the guide below.
</Callout>

To restake your ankrETH, you need to first deposit ankrETH on EigenLayer and then delegate it to an AVS operator.
## Deposit ankrETH on EigenLayer
1. Make sure you have first staked your ETH in [Ethereum Liquid Staking](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/) and then visit the [ankrETH restaking page](https://goerli.eigenlayer.xyz/token/ankrETH).
2. Click **Connect Wallet**.

## Delegate your deposit to an operator
Now you need to delegate your deposit to an operator to earn you rewards:
1. Visit the [Operator page](https://goerli.eigenlayer.xyz/operator).
2. Choose an operator and click **Manage**. We recommend Ankr as a stable operator with favorable reward terms.

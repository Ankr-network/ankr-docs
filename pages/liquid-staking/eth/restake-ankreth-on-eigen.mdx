# Restake ankrETH on EigenLayer

Once you have staked ETH in Ethereum Liquid Staking, you have an opportunity to restake it on EigenLayer.

To restake your ankrETH, you need to:
1. Deposit ankrETH on EigenLayer.
2. Delegate your deposit to an AVS operator (currently only available for testing on Goerli; Mainnet version is coming around April 2024).

## Deposit ankrETH on EigenLayer
<Callout type="info">
  EigenLayer [reopens for restaking on Ethereum Mainnet](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/introducing-new-lsts-and-unpausing-restaking-caps/).<br/>
    You will be able to deposit from *Jan 29th, 12 PM PT to Feb 2nd, 12 PM PT*.<br/>
    Why deposit? Your deposit gains you Restaked Points that make you eligible for the upcoming airdrop, and [not only EigenLayer's](https://twitter.com/alt_layer/status/1750014580510572660?s=20) — giveaway of a protocol’s tokens that could have great worth on the market.

## Delegate your deposit to an operator
<Callout type="info">
  *EigenLayer has not yet released the delegating feature on their Mainnet.*<br/>
    The release is touted to be around April 2024.<br/>
</Callout>
Right now, you have a chance to test out delegating to Ankr's AVS operator on Ethereum Goerli.<br/>
Before testing out, ensure you have [staked goETH on Ankr](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/) and [deposited ankrETH on EigenLayer Goerli](https://goerli.eigenlayer.xyz/token/ankrETH).

When you're ready, delegate your deposit to a Testnet operator to earn you rewards:
1. Visit the [Goerli operator page](https://eigenlayer.xyz/operator).
2. Choose an operator and click **Manage**. We recommend Ankr as a stable operator with favorable reward terms.

3. On the operator detail page, click **Delegate**.

## Undelegate from the operator
<Callout type="info">
  *EigenLayer has not yet released the undelegating feature on their Mainnet.*<br/>
    The release is [touted to be around April 2024](https://twitter.com/eigenlayer/status/1742353872537190801?s=20).<br/>

If you've already [delegated your deposit on Goerli](/liquid-staking/eth/restake-ankreth-on-eigen/#delegate-your-deposit-to-an-operator), you can undelegate it from Ankr's AVS operator on Goerli.<br/>
1. Visit the [Goerli operator page](https://goerli.eigenlayer.xyz/operator).
2. From the operators you have delegated to, choose an operator and click **Manage**.

## Withdraw your deposit

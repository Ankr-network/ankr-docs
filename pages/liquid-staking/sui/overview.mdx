# SUI Liquid Staking

## What and why is SUI Liquid Staking?
Ankr Staking offers SUI token holders the opportunity to stake SUI and in return claim SUI Liquid Staking tokens — ankrSUI.
ankrSUI is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrSUI token vs. SUI increases over time as staking rewards accumulate inside the token.<br/>
ankrSUI also offers instant liquidity for your staked SUI, enabling you to connect ankrSUI with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards (currently, under development).

## Benefits

### Boosted yields
As Liquid Staking solves the capital inefficiency problem of (Nominated) Proof-of-stake networks, it offers a way to earn additional rewards on your staked SUI, enabling new yield farming strategies. The main components of SUI Liquid Staking will be:

* **Liquidity mining opportunities** are enabled by providing liquidity for pools in decentralized exchanges.
* **Farming rewards for liquidity providers**: Liquid Staking presents several yield farming strategies for users to contribute to liquidity pools and gain a share of the trading fees and governance tokens. These new LP tokens can be used to generate yet another layer of earnings.
* **Staking rewards on farmed tokens**: After using yield farming strategies, users can also reinvest their farmed LP tokens into more staking opportunities. This is a highly repeatable process as layers of rewards from farming and staking will quickly stack up.
* **Yield aggregators /vaults** can automate yield farming rewards and enable compounding returns with next to no effort from users. This is a great method for maximizing your passive income strategy.
* **More trading opportunities** are enabled thanks to the elastic supply nature of ankrSUI, meaning that you could potentially buy ankrSUI at a discount on a Decentralized Exchange and redeem it (unstake it) on Ankr Staking to extract its fair value back in up to 7–15 days (the SUI Liquid Staking unbonding period).

### More flexibility
If you would like to unstake your SUI, you can choose the “unstake” option at any time on the Ankr Staking platform. You can choose two options: regular unstake or flash unstake. With regular unstake, you will need to wait up to 1 day before the funds are released to your wallet, while with flash unstake you get them instantly.
This creates a more robust price stability mechanism for SUI Liquid Staking, where any price deviation of ankrSUI vs. its fair value will create trading opportunities that can be exploited by redeeming ankrSUI while unstaking SUI or minting ankrSUI while staking SUI. That means if you could potentially buy ankrSUI at a discount on a DEX and unstake it on Ankr Staking at its fair value to make a profit! Therefore,  ankrSUI price stability will be less dependent on the size of liquidity pools and associated rewards. Borrowing and lending the ankrSUI tokens will also allow users to borrow against their ankrSUI assets in exchange for assets like SUI that can be restaked or used for additional earning strategies. Or, lend your  ankrSUI assets in return for interest paid by borrowers.

### No technical knowledge required
Receive an easier staking experience with no technical knowledge necessary. Liquid Staking makes staking as easy as a swap: exchange your SUI for the reward bearing ankrSUI token. Enhanced decentralization Our SUI Liquid Staking will not be using only Ankr validator nodes to stake the SUI from users. Ankr Staking will select several suitable and reliable SUI validators, making SUI Liquid Staking as decentralized as possible. This means that Ankr will not contribute to giving any party more influence over the SUI network as the SUI will be spread over a wide variety of nodes. Ultimately, the end goal is having Ankr governance decide on the target allocation to different validator nodes.

### Contribute to the security of the SUI network
Staking with SUI Liquid Staking allows you to play an important role in boosting the network’s security as a whole. Ankr’s SUI staking system distributes staked tokens intelligently across the SUI Chain ecosystem to help the network achieve optimal decentralization. Diversity and decentralization of active validators both ensure the network remains as secure as possible.

### More benefits
Instant Liquidity Using Ankr Staking is the best way to stake SUI as you can access instant liquidity in the form of the ankrSUI token.
Avoiding locking your tokens up with the SUI network is a big advantage — it allows you to use the value of your staked tokens to earn multiple layers of rewards on DeFi platforms and multiply your ROI potential.

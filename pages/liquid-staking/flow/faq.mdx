### Which wallets are compatible with the ankrFLOW tokens?

ankrFLOW is an ERC-20 token that is compatible with Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask.

### Are there any docs about the FLOW staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

Yes — there is a [user guide](https://www.ankr.com/docs/liquid-staking/flow/stake/).

### What is the minimum amount of FLOW I can stake?

Currently, there is no minimum amount defined for FLOW staking.

### Why do I get less ankrFLOW for my 1 FLOW?

ankrFLOW only changes in value, which is why the amount of ankrFLOW you get when staking is calculated by the formula `stake * exchange_ratio`. The exchange ratio is calculated like this: `totals_supply_of_ankrFLOW / (total_staked_FLOW + total_rewards_for_staked_FLOW - total_unstaked_ankrFLOW)`.

### Is there a maximum amount I can stake?

You can stake at your discretion, unlimited.

### How long does it take to unstake my FLOW?

You receive the unstaked FLOW after the unbonding period of 7–15 days.

### How do I receive rewards?

ankrFLOW is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. Instead, it appreciates in value in relation to FLOW, so the redemption price of 1 ankrFLOW will grow over time because of reward accumulation.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

ankrFLOW rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as ankrFLOW grows in value to FLOW.

### Does Ankr charge for the service?

Ankr takes a 10% technical service fee from the staking reward to cover the provided services and operations. Your APY already includes the fee, so no need to recalculate it; you get what you see.

### If I click Unstake, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?

Your stake immediately **stops** accumulating rewards once you've clicked **Unstake**.

### Is there any liquidity for my Liquid Staking tokens anywhere?

To be added soon...

### Can I get staking metrics for my integration?

Yes, if you want to integrate Ankr Liquid Staking into your product, read [Liquid Staking Metrics](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking-for-developers/restful-api/staking-metrics/).

### Can I use cold wallets for staking?

Yes, you can use Ledger Nano cold wallets through MetaMask. Visit the Ledger's [guide on connecting Ledger through MetaMask](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask).

### How soon will I receive my funds when unstaked?

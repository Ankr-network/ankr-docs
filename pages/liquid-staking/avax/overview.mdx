# Avalanche Liquid Staking

## What and why is Avalanche Liquid Staking?
Ankr Staking offers Avalanche token holders the opportunity to stake AVAX and in return claim Avalanche Liquid Staking tokens â€” ankrAVAX (ex-aAVAXc). 
ankrAVAX is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrAVAX token vs. AVAX increases over time as staking rewards accumulate inside the token.<br/>
ankrAVAX also offers instant liquidity for your staked AVAX, enabling you to connect ankrAVAX with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

### Access Instant Liquidity Pools

* Ankr token holders can gain access to instant liquidity pools. This allows them to sell 1 ankrAVAX against 1 AVAX instantly and subject to the instant liquidity pool capacity. 

* 3% of the allocated AVAX tokens to Ankr Staking will not be staked and will remain unstaked.

* ankrAVAX holders indirectly bear the cost of the instant liquidity pool, which will represent 3% of the staking rewards due to the missed opportunity to stake AVAX. Therefore, the total cost for ankrAVAX holders will be 2% service fee, plus 3% missed opportunity to stake AVAX, which equals 4.94% (no service fee applied to 3% instant liquidity pool).

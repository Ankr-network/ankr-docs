# Unstake AVAX

## Release time
If you decide to unstake, it can take up to 4 weeks before you can claim your funds.

Unstaking AVAX tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the AVAX smart contracts deployed in Avalanche.

AVAX is transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes; there is no additional cost for transferring it.

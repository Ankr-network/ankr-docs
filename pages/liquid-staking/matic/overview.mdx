ankrMATIC a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrMATIC token vs. MATIC increases over time as staking rewards accumulate inside the token.<br/>
ankrMATIC also offers instant liquidity for your staked MATIC, enabling you to connect ankrMATIC with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

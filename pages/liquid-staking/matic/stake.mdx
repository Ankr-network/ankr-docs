### Stake your MATIC
<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have a small surplus of MATIC or ETH to pay the gas fees for the staking transaction.<br/>
Normally, it is around 0.0005 ETH and a fraction of MATIC, but may vary depending on the transaction complexity and network transaction load.<br/>
    Ankr deducts a fee of 5% of your staking reward for providing you the services. The fee is auto-deducted each reward cycle.

<Callout type="warning">

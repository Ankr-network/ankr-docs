### How can I set up my wallet and stake POL?

Check the [Stake POL](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/pol/stake/) user guide.

### What is the minimum and maximum amount of POL I can stake?

Minimum amount:

* Staking POL on Ethereum, your minimum amount is 1 POL.

* Staking POL on Polygon, there is no minimum amount.

Maximum amount:

* Staking POL on Ethereum, there is no maximum amount.

* Staking POL on Polygon, your maximum amount is limited by the cross-chain staking pool capacity. You will see the capacity while staking.

### What is the difference between POL staking on Ethereum and Polygon?

POL staking happens on Ethereum. You can stake/unstake any POL amount at once. Ethereum gas fee applies. Also, when unstaking, you receive your POL and rewards after the 3–4 days unbonding period.  

  

POL cross-chain staking happens on Polygon. You may have to stake/unstake your POL in portions, as you’re doing it via a cross-chain staking pool, which may not have the amount you need at the moment. Also, an additional fee applies. However, there is no unbonding period, so when unstaking you receive your POL and rewards instantly.

### How long does it take to unstake my POL?

If you staked on Ethereum, you’ll receive your POL and rewards after the unbonding period of 80+ epochs; typically, it takes 3–4 days.  

  

If you staked on Polygon via the cross-chain staking pool, you’ll receive your POL and rewards instantly.

### How do I receive rewards?

ankrPOL is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. Instead, it appreciates in value in relation to POL, so the redemption price of 1 ankrPOL will grow over time because of reward accumulation.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

ankrPOL rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as ankrPOL grows in value relative to POL.

### Does Ankr charge for the service?

Ankr takes a 5% technical service fee from the staking reward to cover for the provided services and operations.   

Remember that when staking on Ethereum, the user pays a gas fee (typically, 0.0005 ETH), and when staking on Polygon, the user may pay a small dynamic fee.  

Also, remember that when unstaking on Polygon, the user pays a technical service fee of 0.5% from the unstaking amount.

### If I click Unstake, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?

Your stake **continues** to accumulate rewards until the moment you have received them.

### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline. The delegated staked POL is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

### Is there any liquidity for my Liquid Staking tokens anywhere?

You can trade them in the listed liquidity pools on ANKR DeFi:

* [ankrPOL](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/?assets=ankrPOL)

You can also use your Liquid Staking tokens to:

* [Add liquidity on DEXs](https://www.ankr.com/docs/defi/liquidity-pools/) and earn from commissions taken when users swap tokens, using the liquidity pool you're a part of.

* [Yield farm](https://www.ankr.com/docs/defi/yield-farming/) and earn additional rewards in the form of liquidity pool tokens and further farm them.

* [Put your tokens in a vault](https://www.ankr.com/docs/defi/vaults/) and automatically earn additional rewards in the form of one of both assets from the pair.

### Why do I get less ankrPOL for my 1 POL?

ankrPOL only changes in value, which is why the amount of ankrPOL you get when staking is calculated by the formula `stake * exchange_ratio`. The exchange ratio is calculated like this: `totals_supply_of_ankrpol / (total_staked_pol + total_rewards_for_staked_pol - total_unstaked_ankrpol)`.

### Can I use cold wallets for staking?

Yes, you can use Ledger Nano cold wallets through MetaMask. Visit the Ledger's [guide on connecting Ledger through MetaMask](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask).

### Are there any docs about the DOT staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

Yes — there is a [user guide](https://www.ankr.com/docs/liquid-staking/pol/stake/).

### Can I get staking metrics for my integration?

Yes, if you want to integrate Ankr Liquid Staking into your product, read [Liquid Staking Metrics](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking-for-developers/restful-api/staking-metrics/).

### Can I unstake my ankrPOL on Polygon?

ankrPOL supports staking and unstaking on Polygon.

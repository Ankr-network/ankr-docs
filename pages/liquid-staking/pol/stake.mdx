### Stake your POL

<Callout type="tip">
We have made a separate [testnet version of Polygon Liquid Staking on Polygon Testnet](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/)! <br/>
    Anybody interested to test Liquid Staking without spending mainnet POL, come and try it!<br/>
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have a small surplus of POL or ETH to pay the gas fees for the staking transaction.<br/>
Normally, it is around 0.0005 ETH and a fraction of POL, but may vary depending on the transaction complexity and network transaction load.<br/>
    Ankr deducts a technical service fee of 5% from your staking reward, each reward cycle.

1. Visit [Ankr Staking](https://www.ankr.com/staking/stake).
2. Locate the **Polygon (POL)** box and click **Stake** in it.

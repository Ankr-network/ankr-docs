# Polygon Liquid Staking

## What and why is Polygon Liquid Staking?
Ankr Staking offers Polygon token holders the opportunity to stake POL and in return claim Polygon Liquid Staking tokens — ankrPOL.
ankrPOL a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrPOL token vs. POL increases over time as staking rewards accumulate inside the token.

ankrPOL also offers instant liquidity for your staked POL, enabling you to connect ankrPOL with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

<Callout type="tip">
We have made a separate [testnet version of Polygon Liquid Staking on Polygon Testnet](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/stake/ethereum/)! <br/>
    Anybody interested to test Liquid Staking without spending mainnet POL, come and try it!<br/>
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
You can stake your POL both on the Ethereum and native Polygon networks.

# How To Build An ERC-20 token On Optimism's Lightning-Fast Ethereum L2 Blockchain

**By** [**Manny**](https://twitter.com/codingwithmanny)
________________

## What We're Building
If you have ever wanted to create your own type of currency or token that would be used as a means for an exchange of value or trading then you‚Äôre in the right place today. We‚Äôll be building and deploying an ERC-20 Token to Optimism Kovan Testnet.

We‚Äôll be walking you through the entire process of coding, testing, setting up your network, adding tokens via a faucet, deploying the contract to the Optimism testnet, and interacting with it via a

## Wait, What‚Äôs Optimism?

Optimism is a fast and transactionally cheap L2 EVM Blockchain that lets developers build contracts on top of its chain with Solidity. If you‚Äôd like to read more about what Optimism is, there is a great article on CoinMarketCap explaining its advantages and differences.

### Requirements
Before we start, here is a list of things you‚Äôll need on your computer:

- NVM or Node v16.15.1+
- Yarn
- VSCode
- Metamask Wallet

## Project Setup
To start, we‚Äôre going to leverage Hardhat to develop, compile, test, and deploy our contract locally. If you‚Äôre not familiar, this will be a good primer to start with.

<img src="/docs/learn/rTVWirrkB.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

To start, we‚Äôre going to scaffold out a new project with TypeScript.

```bash
mkdir optimism-erc20;
cd optimism-erc20;
npx hardhat;

If we open up our project in VSCode we should see big list of files generated for us, but don‚Äôt worry we won‚Äôt need to use all of them.

<img src="/docs/learn/C2wDPA7xh.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


## Creating Our Contract
Now that we have all our files, we‚Äôre going to start off by modifying our current Solidity contract (`Greeter.sol`) in the `contracts` folder by renaming it to `Buidl.sol` and making the following modifications.

File: `./contracts/Buidl.sol`

```javascript
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BuidlToken {
}
```

With that base in place, we‚Äôre now going to leverage some existing code to easily build our own ERC-20 token on top of a widely adopted standard. To do this, we‚Äôll be using OpenZeppelin‚Äôs contract npm package.

<img src="/docs/learn/rbbL8ro7j.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

```bash
# /optimism-erc20
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts;
```
With this newly installed npm package, we can add it to our contract, extend the contract, and pass the default attributes needed to define the name and its symbol.


```java
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract BuidlToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("BuidlToken", "BDL") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```
That‚Äôs it! We have our ERC-20 token. The reason why our code is so short is because we‚Äôre using all the functions defined by the OpenZeppelin ERC20.sol file. The file provided by OpenZeppelin is an inherited set of functions from the ERC-20 contract, which you can more details on here. In VSCode, you can actually see the functions by doing Command (PC CTRL) + Click on the ERC20.sol part of the import.

<img src="/docs/learn/2GPJfTK3O.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


This should open up the file located in your node_modules folder and show you the [contents](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) of the entire file we‚Äôre extending.

<img src="/docs/learn/lM8jBQ5Xr.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


There is one thing that we need to factor in with this default ERC-20 token and that is that the supply can only be defined once, at the time of the contract deployed. We‚Äôre going to make a slight modification to our contract to make it so that only the owner (the wallet that deployed the contract) can modify the supply after the contract has been deployed.


```java
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract BuidlToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("BuidlToken", "BDL") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }

    /**
     * Contract Owner - Increase the total supply and add it to their wallet
     */
    function mint(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        _mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    /**
     * User - Decrease their total supply
     */
    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```
## Deploying Our Contract Locally

The next step is to deploy our contract to our local development environment to make sure things compile correctly. To do that we‚Äôll need modify `deploy.ts`.

File: `./scripts/deploy.ts`

```java
// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// When running the script with `npx hardhat run <script>` you'll find the Hardhat
// Runtime Environment's members available in the global scope.
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  // Hardhat always runs the compile task when running scripts with its command
  // line interface.
  //
  // If this script is run directly using `node` you may want to call compile
  // manually to make sure everything is compiled
  // await hre.run('compile');

  // We get the contract to deploy
  const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("BuidlToken");
  const contract = await Contract.deploy(1000); // Create 1000 initial tokens

  await contract.deployed();

  console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```
After we‚Äôve modified the file we‚Äôll need to run two Terminals to get things deployed. The first one is to run the local development Ethereum Virtual Machine and the second is to deploy it to that environment.

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
# TERMINAL 1
# /optimism-erc20

./node_modules/.bin/hardhat node;

## Testing Our Contract

A good habit is that when you have your contract code, is to create a series of tests to make sure that things are working as expected. As a brief overview of how I structure tests, the guideline I try to aim for is the following:

```
1 - Imports
2 - Configurations
3 - Helpers (Optional)
4 - Tests
    A - Function One Expected Failure(s)
    B - Function One Expected Success(es)
    C - Function Two ...
    D - Scenario(s)
```

Taking this guide into consideration, the main things we‚Äôre going to test for are:

1. **Minting** - Increasing the supply
2. **Burning** - Decreasing the supply
3. **Approving** - Giving another user permission to spend tokens on our behalf
4. **Transferring** - Moving tokens from one user to another
5. **Scenario Insufficient Tokens** - A user has the permission to spend tokens of another user but the tokens are already spent or burned

**NOTE:** This is a lot of code to read, but gives you some insight as to how tests are written. If you want to skip this part, just scroll through it, but if you want to test your code, I recommend just copying it for now.

```
**NOTE: You might get this error in TypeScript**

```
ContractABI is declared but its value is never read.
```

To fix this, add `resolveJsonModule` to your `tsconfig.json` file:

File: `./tsconfig.json`
```bash
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },
  "include": ["./scripts", "./test", "./typechain"],
  "files": ["./hardhat.config.ts"]
}
```
In another Terminal, if we run the tests, we should get the following results:

```bash
# /optimism-erc20
./node_modules/.bin/hardhat --network localhost test;

# Expected Output

## Deploying To Testnet

Now that we have our code and our tests validate the different scenarios, we are ready to deploy our ERC-20 Token contract to Optimism‚Äôs Kovan Testnet. Before we start, we‚Äôll need to configure our Metamask wallet with Optimism‚Äôs Testnet and then add native Optimism tokens to it with a faucet.

## Getting Testnet Tokens From A Faucet

Once you have Optimism Testnet supported in your Metmask wallet is to get Testnet tokens. You can do this by going to `https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/`. You will need a Twitter account, but once you sign in, you should be able to enter your wallet address and click claim.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Remember to click the checkbox for "Drip on additional networks"

If you don‚Äôt have a Twitter account, you can use some of these faucet options as alternatives:

- https://kovan.optifaucet.com
- https://optimismfaucet.xyz

<img src="/docs/learn/5dYFHOWWv.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


## Deployment Configuration
Now that we have the tokens in our wallet, we just need to need to create our environment variable file (.env) and modify our hardhat.config.ts to add the Optimism network to it.

Let‚Äôs first start by modifying our .env.example file:

File: `./.env.example`

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1
OPTIMISM_KOVAN_URL=https://kovan.optimism.io
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc1
```

Next we‚Äôll make a copy of it and paste our wallet private key to the PRIVATE_KEY section.

REMEMBER: Never share this private key with anyone, not even your mom.

```
cp .env.example .env;
```
Next, we‚Äôll need to get our wallet private key.
<img src="/docs/learn/u1ZTG3u4J.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/QFjlhRkS0.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/dZgJfym-D.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/pQHpLyko_.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

Once we have it, add it to our newly created .env file.

File: `./.env`

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1
OPTIMISM_KOVAN_URL=https://kovan.optimism.io
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-WALLET-SECRET-PRIVATE-KEY>
```
With these details entered, we just need to modify our hardhat.config.ts to support these new values and the Optimism Kovan testnet.

File: `./hardhat.config.ts`

```javascript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

import { HardhatUserConfig, task } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle";
import "@typechain/hardhat";
import "hardhat-gas-reporter";
import "solidity-coverage";

dotenv.config();

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});

// You need to export an object to set up your config
// Go to https://hardhat.org/config/ to learn more

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    // ! START HERE - ADD THIS
    optimismKovan: {
      url: process.env.OPTIMISM_KOVAN_URL || "",
      accounts:
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    },
        // END HERE !
  },
  gasReporter: {
    enabled: process.env.REPORT_GAS !== undefined,
    currency: "USD",
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
  },
};

export default config;
```
## Finally Deploying & Verifying Deployment

Everything is now setup, now we can deploy our contract to the Optimism Kovan Testnet.

Run the following and enjoy the miracle of deploying to the blockchain.

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network optimismKovan;

# Expected Ouput
# No need to generate any newer typings.
# Contract deployed to: 0x375F01b156D9BdDDd41fd38c5CC74C514CB71f73
```
Using [Etherscan‚Äôs Optimism Kovan Blockchain Explorer](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/), we can search for the deployed contract.

<img src="/docs/learn/yRxH7z_qa.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

## Verifying Our Contract

Now that we have our contract deployed, we want to be able to interact with it via the blockchain explorer and in order to do that we need to verify its source code. This part requires creating an account with Optimistic Etherscan and generating an API key.

<img src="/docs/learn/C2yRmq9yu.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

To do this, you‚Äôll need to go to https://optimistic.etherscan.io/, sign up for a new account, and then make your way to the API Key section to generate a new key. With this key you‚Äôll be pasting it into you .env file.
<img src="/docs/learn/weUkOGtKX.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/UUf5rKRtq.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/QXKJN3C_f.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />





With the newly created API key, copy it to this file.

File: `./.env`

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<YOUR-OPTIMISTIC-ETHERSCAN-API-KEY>
OPTIMISM_KOVAN_URL=https://kovan.optimism.io
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-WALLET-SECRET-PRIVATE-KEY>
```
Now that we have all the right values, we can run the following to validate the contract.

```bash
# /optimism-erc20
# NOTE:
# 1 - 0x375... refers to the deployed contract address
# 2 - 1000 refers to the original 1000 supply parameter deployed in our deploy.ts file 
./node_modules/.bin/hardhat verify --network optimismKovan 0x375F01b156D9BdDDd41fd38c5CC74C514CB71f73 1000

# Expected Output
# Nothing to compile
# No need to generate any newer typings.
# Successfully submitted source code for contract
# contracts/Buidl.sol:BuidlToken at 0x375F01b156D9BdDDd41fd38c5CC74C514CB71f73
# for verification on the block explorer. Waiting for verification result...

# Successfully verified contract BuidlToken on Etherscan.
# https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x375F01b156D9BdDDd41fd38c5CC74C514CB71f73#code
```
Now if we look on the test net we‚Äôll see a bunch of functions that are available to us.

<img src="/docs/learn/AQAmipGq8.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


## Minting Tokens

Our final step is to increase the total supply by minting more token through the blockchain explorer. To do this you‚Äôll head over to the Contract section and select Write Contract. From there you‚Äôll need to connect your wallet (the wallet address which deployed the contract) and use the mint function.

<img src="/docs/learn/X4qxLJCR0.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />
<img src="/docs/learn/KXl4DfKYG.png" alt="Hello" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />


Once the transaction is complete, you can verify the total supply by going back the Read Contract section and expanding the totalSupply section to see the new supply being reflected.

# Bridge tokens

We're going to explain bridging, using ankrETH (ex-aETHc).

## Bridge ankrETH
1. Visit [Ankr Bridge](https://www.ankr.com/staking/bridge/) and choose ankrETH.
2. Enter the desired ankrETH amount to bridge and click **Approve** to allow Ankr Bridge smart contracts to bridge for you.

3. Confirm your approval in MetaMask.

4. Click **get ankrETH** to send ankrETH to the destination network.

5. Confirm bridging ankrETH in MetMask. We recommend choosing the **high fee** value for faster transaction mining time.

6. **Keep the page open, do not navigate away or close the tab**. Ankr Bridge shows you the sending progress. Wait till the cross-chain transaction successfully finishes.

12. Click **Add ankrPOL to wallet** to add the bridged tokens to MetaMask.<br/> You can also see the transaction in the explorer by clicking the **go-to** button next to the transaction hash.

If something failed along the way after #5, see the **Finish Bridge** section below.

## Finish Bridge
The *Finish Bridge* functionality allows you to get back to the bridging process if anything fails. 

The bridging process may fail due to: 
* Navigating away from the Bridge page anytime during the process.
* Closing the page anytime during the process.
* Ankr Bridge failures due to network instability and other possible issues. 

If the process failed anywhere before #5 from **Bridge ankrPOL**, no action is needed. Just start bridging again.

If the process failed at #5 or later: 
1. Open your wallet, find and copy the transaction ID from the **Deposit** operation.
2. Visit [Ankr Bridge](https://www.ankr.com/staking/bridge/). 
3. Click **Finish Bridge**.

4. Paste the deposit transaction ID in the form and click **Proceed bridge**.
   <img src="/docs/staking/bridge/click-proceed.jpg" alt="Click proceed bridge" className="responsive-pic" width="450" />
5. Check that it brought you to the **Sending progress** page, then continue from #6 in the **Bridge ankrPOL** instructions above.

# Stake GNO token
To stake GNO, you'll need to:
1. Purchase GNO on Ethereum.
2. Bridge GNO to Gnosis.
4. Connect your wallet at Ankr Staking.
5. Stake GNO at Ankr.

## Before you start
Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a [MetaMask wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed and set up in Chrome.

## Get GNO
Visit one of the [recommended DEXs](https://docs.gnosischain.com/ecosystems/defi#dex-aggregators) and swap your assets for the desired amount of GNO tokens.

</Callout>

## Bridge GNO to Gnosis Chain
Your obtained GNO is likely to be the Ethereum Mainnet GNO version.
To use it on Gnosis, you'll need to bridge it to Gnosis Chain.

* Use the [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) to move GNO from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain.
* Add Gnosis to your wallet, visiting [Ankr Gnosis RPC page](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/gnosis/) and clicking **Add network**. Alternatively, use [these manual instructions](https://docs.gnosischain.com/tools/wallets/metamask) from Gnosis.

You're ready to stake your GNO on Ankr Staking.

## Stake GNO
<Callout type="tip">
We have made a separate [testnet version of Gnosis Delegated Staking on Chiado](https://testnet.ankr.com/staking/gno-stake/stake/)! <br/>
    Anybody interested to test Liquid Staking without spending mainnet GNO, come and try it!<br/>
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
Your stake does not immediately gets staked on Gnosis.
Gnosis accepts stakes with minimum 1 GNO.
To bypass this and accept your stake if it's lower than 1 GNO, we created a micropool that accumulates user stakes.
Once it has 1 GNO, we stake it with Gnosis.<br/>
Make sure you have some xDai to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

# Stake mGNO token

To stake mGNO, you'll need to:
1. Purchase GNO on Ethereum.
2. Bridge GNO to Gnosis.
3. Convert the bridged GNO to mGNO.
4. Connect your wallet at Ankr Staking.
5. Stake mGNO at Ankr.

## Before you start

Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a [MetaMask wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed and set up in Chrome.

## Get GNO
Visit one of the [recommended DEXs](https://docs.gnosischain.com/ecosystems/defi#dex-aggregators) and swap your assets for the desired amount of GNO tokens.

<Callout type="info">
You'll need a small amount of xDai for gas fees while depositing GNO and staking mGNO.
</Callout>

## Bridge GNO to Gnosis Chain
Your obtained GNO is likely to be the Ethereum Mainnet GNO version.
To use it on Gnosis, you'll need to bridge it to Gnosis Chain.

* Use the [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) to move GNO from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain.
* Add Gnosis to your wallet, visiting [Ankr Gnosis RPC page](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/gnosis/) and clicking **Add network**. Alternatively, use [these manual instructions](https://docs.gnosischain.com/tools/wallets/metamask) from Gnosis.

## Convert the bridged GNO to mGNO
<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have some xDai to pay the gas fee for your depositing transaction.<br/>
Remember that mGNO will remain locked and illiquid until ~Q4 2023 max.
This is due to Gnosis plans to enable withdrawals in the Shanghai upgrade. Shanghai is planned in 6–12 months from The Merge that is expected in ~Q3/Q4 2022.
</Callout>
To convert your bridged GNO to mGNO: 
1. Visit the GNO–mGNO converter at https://mgno.validategnosis.com/.
2. Connect your wallet.

## Stake mGNO

<Callout type="info">
Your stake does not immediately gets staked on Gnosis.
Gnosis accepts stakes with minimum 1 GNO (32 mGNO).
To bypass this and accept your stake if it's lower than 1 GNO, we created a micropool that accumulates user stakes.
Once it has 1 GNO, we stake it with Gnosis.<br/>
Make sure you have some xDai to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

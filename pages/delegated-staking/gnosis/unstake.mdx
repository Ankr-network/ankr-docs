# Unstake GNO

## Release time
Unstaking GNO has a dynamic unbond period, depending on the current unstake queue on Gnosis.
It means that the release time for your GNO tokens may vary, but on average it takes 3â€“4 days before you get your GNO back along with the accrued rewards.
<Callout type="info">
    As for now, there is no separate reward-claiming mechanism. You will get your rewards along with the unstaked GNO.
</Callout>

## Unstake GNO
<Callout type="info">
    You'll need a small amount of xDai the gas fee while unstaking GNO.
    You can choose to unstake the whole staked amount or leave a minimum amount of GNO staked, which is currently 0.00001 GNO (may possibly be changed by Ankr in the future).

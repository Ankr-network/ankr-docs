# BNB staking mechanics

BNB Liquid Staking lets the user stake their funds through the corresponding smart contracts on the Binance network, accumulate rewards, and receive their stake and rewards when unstaking.

The following section explains staking requirements, fees, rewards, validators, smart contracts and function calls to interact with these smart contracts.


## Requirements

The requirements when staking are:

* Minimum value to stake — 0.502 BNB (the 0.002 part is the relayer fee added on top of 0.5 BNB).

* Maximum value to stake — unlimited, at the user’s discretion.

The requirements when unstaking are:
* Minimum value to unstake — 0.5 BNB.
* Maximum value to unstake — up to the initial stake for ankrBNB.
* Unbond time (before user gets their unstaked funds) — 7–15 days.
* Splitting large unstaked amounts between several unbond times due to limited nodes capacities.


## Fees

* Ankr takes 10% fee from the staking reward. 

* When staking, the user pays the relayer fee — 0.002 BNB, which is a fee for transferring assets between BNB Chain (prev. Binance Chain) and BNB Beacon Chain (prev. Binance Chain).

* When unstaking, the user pays nothing, while Ankr pays:

  * Unbonding transaction fee (undelegate_fee) — 0.004 BNB.

  * Cross-chain transaction fee (transfer_out_fee) — 0.000075 BNB.

The user must also count in the gas price for outgoing transactions.


## Rewards
Validators receive rewards every day, at midnight, UTC.

The APY is calculated from the validators' rewards. 

The rewards the user gets are calculated using the exchange ratio explained later in this document.

To understand BNB Liquid Staking, you need to know the entities and understand the workflow under the hood.

The following entities are involved:
* Smart contracts
* Ankr addresses
* Ankr validators

## Smart contracts
Smart contracts and addresses involved in BNB Liquid Staking are:
* [BNBStakingPool](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9e347Af362059bf2E55839002c699F7A5BaFE86E) — contract on BNB Chain where the user sends their initial staking or unstaking request.
* [Staking](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002001) — withdraws the rewards and send them to `BNBStakingPool`.
* [aBNBb Proxy](https://bscscan.com/address/0xfe39985D7eFF914c50A06bA0cFfcCA8361e00C0e) — contract on BNB Chain is an intermediary in the ankrBNB staking and unstaking process.
* [ankrBNB Proxy](https://bscscan.com/address/0x52F24a5e03aee338Da5fd9Df68D2b6FAe1178827) — contract on BNB Chain that mints or burns ankrBNB tokens for the user. All interactions go through the Proxy part.
* [TokenHub](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001004) — contract on BNB Chain that makes cross-chain transfers between BNB Chain and Binance Chain.
* [Intermediary address](https://explorer.binance.org/address/bnb1lyhlnk763duq48rmctftxlde6ax3htxkxnay3e)  — BNB backend service on Binance Chain that:
  * When staking, receives the staked funds from BinancePool to send to the validators. 
  * When unstaking, receives the unstaked funds to later crosschain-send it to the operator address. 
* [Operator address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362) — BNB backend service on BNB Chain that:
  * When unstaking, receives the unstaked funds+rewards to send to stakers.

## Validators
* [Ankr validator](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/staking/validator/bva1xnudjls7x4p48qrk0j247htt7rl2k2dzp3mr3j)

## Staking workflow
1. User sends a request to the `BNBStakingPool::stakeCerts({value:stake})` on BNB Chain. `stake` specifies the staked amount and should meet the requirements described above. `BNBStakingPool` verifies the request checking the `_minimumStake` and mints ankrBNB in the amount defined by the current exchange ratio, and then issues a `Staked()` event with the `staker`, `amount` (staked amount), `shares` (issued ankrBNB), `false` (because ankrBNB is a reward-bearing token) parameters.
2. `BNBStakingPool` accumulates minimum 100 BNB and then sends the accumulated amount via `BNBStakingPool:delegate(validator, amount)` to an address of one of the validators from the Ankr set.

## Exchange ratio 
When staking, the user receives:
* ankrBNB in the amount calculated the following way: `user's_stake * exchange_ratio`.

When unstaking, the user receives `their_stake + accumulated_rewards` in BNB. 
It is calculated by the following formula: `accumulated_amount_ankrBNB / exchange ratio`. 

The exchange ratio is calculated by the following formula: 

```
uint256 totalShares = totalSharesSupply(); == ankrBNB.totalSupply();
uint256 denominator = _totalStaked + totalRewards - _totalUnbondedBonds;
_ratio = (totalShares * 1e18) / denominator;
```

## Unstaking workflow`
1. User sends a request to the `BNBStakingPool::unstakeCerts(shares)` on BNB Chain. `shares` specifies the amount to unstake. You can also unstake to an arbitrarily chosen address via `BNBStakingPool::unstakeCertsFor(receiverAddress, shares)`. `BNBStakingPool` verifies the request checking the `_minimumUnstake` and `balance_of_user`, to transfer ankrBNB from user to the `aBNBb` smart contract address (input amount) then `aBNBb::burn()` executes to decrease total supply of tokens, and then issues a `Unstaked()` event with the `ownerAddress` (message sender), `receiverAddress` (user address for receiving unstaked funds and rewards), `amount` (amount of BNBs to be send to the user), `shares` (amount of ankrBNB to unstake), `false` (because ankrBNB is a reward-bearing token) parameters.
2. BNB backend service waits until `_pendingTotalUnstakes` reaches minimum 100 BNB at `BNBStakingPool`, then calls `BNBStakingPool:undelegate{value: relayerFee}(validator, amount)`.
3. After the `UnbondTime`, `BNBStakingPool` gets the rewards via `Staking:claimUndelegated()` and distributes unstaked funds and rewards to the users.

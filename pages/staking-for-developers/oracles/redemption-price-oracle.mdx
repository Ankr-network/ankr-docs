# Redemption price oracle
The oracle allows you to get the latest ratio and calculate the Redemption Price by one of the formulas mentioned in the Redemption Price explanation.

**Although, technically, it isn't a separate oracle** contract but a method from Liquid Staking token contracts, we chose to present it as such, as logically it can be perceived as a service, and also for better discoverability.

## What is Redemption Price?
The Redemption Price defines the exact amount of assets that a user will get if they redeem their Liquid Staking tokens, after waiting its respective unbonding period. It also defines the amount of Liquid Staking tokens (LSTs) they receive when staking their assets on the Ankr platform.

The formula is:
1. `original_asset = liquid_staking_token / ratio` when the user unstakes their assets. This is why the user gets more assets than the number of the redeemed Liquid Staking tokens.
2. `liquid_staking_token = original_asset * ratio` when the user stakes their assets. This is why the user gets less Liquid Staking tokens than the number of the staked assets.

All this is due to Liquid Staking tokens increasing in value overtime to the originally staked assets, which happens because `ratio = supply / (TVL + rewards * (1-fee))`. For example, `ETH ratio = supply / (TVL + rewards * 0.9)`.

Ankr's Redemption Price should be considered as the primary market, and market prices on Exchanges should be perceived as the second market.

## Redemption price
To get the Redemption Price for an LST, use the `rateProvider` contracts:

## Ratio for bridged tokens
You may also want to get ratio for bridged tokens.<br/>
To remind you what the ratio is, here's the formula: `liquid_staking_token/ratio=original_asset`, e.g., `ankrETH/ratio=ETH`.<br/>
You can get it, calling the `getRatioFor()` function.
The function takes a contract address of the original Liquid Staking token, e.g., `0xE95A203B1a91a908F9B9CE46459d101078c2c3cb` (ankrETH), and returns the ratio as a uint256 if the token has been bridged to the network you're calling the function on.

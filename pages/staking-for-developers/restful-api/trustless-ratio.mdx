# Trustless ratio

## Ethereum
For the transparency, we decided to apply a “proof-of-reserves” solution to the Ethereum Liquid Staking ratio.
All the data is taken from the consensus layer (Beacon) and execution layer (Ethereum) at the same time.
The moment of data fixation' is recorded as a slot (for Beacon; the latest at the time of calculation) and a block (from the slot’s payload).

Ratio — the proportion of ankrETH shares supply in relation to total staked ETH & new ETH that has been earned by validators (block & attestation rewards, MEV, tips).

### Formula:
Given *tvl = (fee_recipient + staking_pool + withdrawal_pool + clBalance - pending_withdrawal - collectable_fee)*, *ratio = shares_supply / tvl*.

### Calculation example:
Given *shares_supply = 27215630108443761510111*
and *tvl = 31789243852435000000000 - 1334272127500000000 + 279331299124130160 - 957321814817038989347 + 3273569179535509862 + 98868842000000000*,
*ratio = shares_supply \* 1e18 / tvl = 882643143435334753*.

### How ratio gets validated
#### Data from Beacon Chain: (clBalance, collectable_fee)
<Callout type="tip">
The examples are using web3.py.
</Callout>
1) Get the Ankr ETH validatorindex from Beaconcha.<br/>
   You can get the validators addresses from the [validator index page](https://beaconcha.in/validators/deposits?q=0x4069D8A3dE3A72EcA86CA5e0a4B94619085E7362) and then use them in the API.<br/>
   For example, for Ankr ETH Liquid Staking validators: `https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/validator/eth1/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362` and `https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/validator/eth1/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362`.
2) Get the Beacon ETH balances of the validators on a specific slot: `balance = beacon.get_validator_balances(state_id=slot)`, using the addresses of the validators from API results at Step 1.<br/>
    To calculate clBalance, sum up the retrieved balance: clBalance = sum(balance).
    To calculate the fee: collectable_fee = sum (balance (if balance>32*1e18) - 32*1e18).

For more details, refer to the [Beacon API docs](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.beacon.html#Beacon.get_validators) and [Beaconcha API interactive docs in Swagger UI](https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/docs/index.html#/).<br/>

## Binance
For the transparency, we decided to apply a “proof-of-reserves” solution to the Binance Liquid Staking ratio.
All the data is taken from the BNB Smart Chain, except *pendingUnstakes* which is taken from BNB Chain.
Ratio — the proportion of ankrBNB shares supply in relation to total staked BNB & new BNB that has been earned by validators (block & attestation rewards, MEV, tips).

### Formula:
Given *availableBalance* is (*poolBalance - stashedAmount - flashUnstakeCollectedFee - totalPendingUnstakes) where:
* shashedAmount — amount for manual claim.
* flashUnstakeCollectedFee — the fee recieved from the swap method.
* totalPendingUnstakes — reserved amount for further distribution.

*ratio = sharesSupply / (totalStaked + availableBalance + pendingUnstakeAmount)*

### Calculation example:
One of the easier ways to calculate such big numbers is to fire up a termnial instance initiate a python session and calculate the ratio right there.<br/>
Given *sharesSupply = 39675028034839723289963*, *totalStaked = 41976176945120000000000*, * availableBalance = 174722818576387031488*, and *pendingUnstakes = 483180222750000000000*, calculating in Python3 syntax will be:
1. `41976176945120000000000 + 174722818576387031488 + 483180222750000000000`, which is 42634079986446387031488.
2. `39675028034839723289963 * 10**18 // 42634079986446387031488`, which is 930594211190968283 — precisely the ratio from our API.

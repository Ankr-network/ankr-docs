# Trustless ratio

## Ethereum
For the transparency, we decided to apply a “proof-of-reserves” solution to the Ethereum Liquid Staking ratio.
All the data is taken from the consensus layer (Beacon) and execution layer (Ethereum) at the same time.
The moment of data fixation' is recorded as a slot (for Beacon; the latest at the time of calculation) and a block (from the slot’s payload).

Ratio — the proportion of ankrETH shares supply in relation to total staked ETH & new ETH that has been earned by validators (block & attestation rewards, MEV, tips).

### Formula:
Given *tvl = (fee_recipient + staking_pool + withdrawal_pool + clBalance - pending_withdrawal - collectable_fee)*, *ratio = shares_supply / tvl*.

### Calculation example:
Given *shares_supply = 27215630108443761510111*
and *tvl = 31789243852435000000000 - 1334272127500000000 + 279331299124130160 - 957321814817038989347 + 3273569179535509862 + 98868842000000000*,
*ratio = shares_supply \* 1e18 / tvl = 882643143435334753*.

### How ratio gets validated
#### Data from Beacon Chain: (clBalance, collectable_fee)
<Callout type="tip">
The examples are using web3.py.
</Callout>
1) Get the Ankr ETH validatorindex from Beaconcha.<br/>
   You can get the validators addresses from the [validator index page](https://beaconcha.in/validators/deposits?q=0x4069D8A3dE3A72EcA86CA5e0a4B94619085E7362) and then use them in the API.<br/>
   For example, for Ankr ETH Liquid Staking validators: `https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/validator/eth1/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362` and `https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/validator/eth1/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362`.
2) Get the Beacon ETH balances of the validators on a specific slot: `balance = beacon.get_validator_balances(state_id=slot)`, using the addresses of the validators from API results at Step 1.<br/>
    To calculate clBalance, sum up the retrieved balance: clBalance = sum(balance).
    To calculate the fee: collectable_fee = sum (balance (if balance>32*1e18) - 32*1e18).

For more details, refer to the [Beacon API docs](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.beacon.html#Beacon.get_validators) and [Beaconcha API interactive docs in Swagger UI](https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/docs/index.html#/).<br/>

## Binance
For the transparency, we decided to apply a “proof-of-reserves” solution to the Binance Liquid Staking ratio.
All data is taken from the consensus layer (BNB Beacon; *pendingUnstakes*) and execution layer (BSC; rest of the formula vars) at the same time.
The moment of data fixation is recorded as blocks for both network.

Ratio — the proportion of ankrBNB shares supply in relation to total staked BNB & new BNB that has been earned by validators (block & attestation rewards, MEV, tips).

### Formula
Given availableBalance is (poolBalance - stashedAmount - flashUnstakeCollectedFee - totalPendingUnstakes) where:
* shashedAmount — amount for manual claim.
* flashUnstakeCollectedFee — the fee recieved from the swap method.
* totalPendingUnstakes — reserved amount for further distribution.

*ratio = sharesSupply / (totalStaked + availableBalance + pendingUnstakeAmount)*

### Calculation example
Given:
* sharesSupply = 39675028034839723289963
* totalStaked = 41976176945120000000000
* availableBalance = 174722818576387031488
* pendingUnstakes = 483180222750000000000

An easy way to operate numbers as big as these is to open a terminal instance, type `python3` and hit **Enter**, and calculate right there:
1. `41976176945120000000000 + 174722818576387031488 + 483180222750000000000` — 42634079986446387031488.
2. `39675028034839723289963 * 10**18 // 42634079986446387031488` — 930594211190968283, precisely the ratio from our API.

    }
  ]
}
```

##### Response params
content — array of data.

* ratio (wei) — the current ratio; ratio = sharesSupply / (totalStaked + availableBalance + pendingUnstakeAmount).
* sharesSupply — total minted ankrBNB.
* totalStaked — total staked BNB.
* availableBalance — current balance available for staking; availableBalance = poolBalance - stashedAmount - flashUnstakeCollectedFee - totalPendingUnstakes).
* pendingUnstakes — pending unstakes.
* bscBlock — block we got all params to calculate the ratio from, except *pendingUnstakes*.
* bcBlock — block we get *pendingUnstakes* from.
* txHash — hash of the transaction where the ratio was published.

### How ratio gets validated
Let’s break down the response:
* totalShares = ankrBNB.totalSupply()
* totalStaked = Staking.getTotalDelegated(BNBStakingPool.address)
* availableBalance = BNBStakingPool.getFreeBalance() - BNBStakingPool.getTotalPendingUnstakes()
* pendingUnstakeAmount =  response.pendingUnstakes

To get the parts of the [ratio formula](#formula-1), pull:
1. Data from BNB Smart Chain RPC.
2. Data from Binance API.

Getting sharesSupply, availableBalance:
```
contract = web3.eth.contract(address='0x52F24a5e03aee338Da5fd9Df68D2b6FAe1178827', abi=abi)
sharesSupply = contract.functions.totalSupply().call(block_identifier = block_number)
```
```
contract = web3.eth.contract(address='0x9e347Af362059bf2E55839002c699F7A5BaFE86E', abi=abi)

totalStaked = contract.functions.getTotalDelegated().call(block_identifier=block_number)

poolBalance = web3.eth.get_balance(account='0x9e347Af362059bf2E55839002c699F7A5BaFE86E', block_identifier=block_number) #balance request
stashedAmount = contract.functions.getStashedForManualClaims().call(block_identifier=block_number)
flashUnstakeCollectedFee = contract.functions.getFlashUnstakeCollectedFee().call(block_identifier=block_number)
totalPendingUnstakes = contract.functions.getTotalPendingUnstakes().call(block_identifier=block_number)
availableBalance = poolBalance - stashedAmount - flashUnstakeCollectedFee - totalPendingUnstakes
```

#### Data from Binance API

Getting pendingUnstakeAmount:
```
url = 'https://api.binance.org/v1/staking/chains/bsc/delegators/bnb1j3xwg6zjjgwp7yjful42908zs089450827wgvm/ubds?limit=100&offset=0'
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()['unbondingDelegations']
```
To calculate *pendingUnstakeAmount* on specific block, you need to do SUM unstakes where specific block was between `creationHeight` and `completeHeight`. Check `completeHeight`; if it is `null`, it mean the unstake is currently still in progress.

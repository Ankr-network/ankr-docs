# Unstake time
If needed, you can check the unstake time.

<Callout type="info"">
Currently, we only provide an unstake time endpoint for the Ethereum blockchain.
</Callout>

## Get unstake time on Ethereum
Unstake time on Ethereum is dynamic and depends on the unstaking queue.<br/>
The endpoint returns the current unstake time value. This value determines the max waiting period you're guaranteed to get your ETH by the end of.
You may actually get your ETH sooner.

The values you obtain by calling the endpoint are:
* `timestamp` (UNIX timestamp) — determines the date and time you're guaranteed to get your ETH by.
* `withdrawableEpoch` (uint256) — determines the Ethereum epoch you're guaranteed to get your ETH by.

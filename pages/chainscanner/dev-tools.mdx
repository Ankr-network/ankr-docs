## Faucet
Faucet is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.

A faucet is available for Testnet. 
It allows you to get free assets for your Testnet and set up or test out your AppChain to perfection, running transactions between addresses or calling smart contracts.

Currently, Ankr provides a faucet only for AppChains on BOMB Testnet.

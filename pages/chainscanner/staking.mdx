# Staking
Staking is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.

As more and more crypto users are getting used to gaining yield on their crypto assets with DeFi in last years, staking is becoming a widespread and demanded service on blockchain.

Staking on AppChains has been created to help users make better use of their crypto assets as well their capable hardware:
* It eases up user interaction, allowing anybody to stake with various validators available on an AppChain. 
* Capable hardware owners can also register to become a validator on an AppChain and make profit from transaction validation, block creation, and users staking with their validator node.

# Block explorer
Block explorer is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.

Chainscaner's block explorer transparently displays all on-chain data and allows you to see what happened on a specific AppChain, in detail.
You can look up such base blockchain entities as wallet addresses, transactions to and from them, blocks that contain transactions.
All that gives you a complete map of what's going on an AppChain and enables you to find specific events and understand how they're connected.

You can see historic events both on AppChains on:
* Testnet, as a developer who's setting up and testing out their AppChain.
* Mainnet, as a user who has interest in a specific AppChain, or a developer of an AppChain who's maintaining it.

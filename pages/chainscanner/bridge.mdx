# Cross-chain bridge

Cross-chain bridge is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.
AppChain's bridge solution is powered by [BridgeHub](http://bridgehub.app/).

The bridge is a single gateway to all AppChains. It allows users to quickly transfer their assets between different AppChains.

You can bridge assets on:
* Testnet, as a developer who's setting up and testing out their AppChain.
* Mainnet, as a user or a developer who needs to bridge assets in or out of an AppChain.

## Use bridge

### Connect your wallet
To connect your wallet:
1. Visit the [Chainscanner's dashboard](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/?network=bas-mapes) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Testnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.

3. Click **Connect wallet** in the top-right corner.

4. In your MetaMask, select an account to connect and click **Next**, then click **Connect**.


### Bridge assets
To bridge your assets to an AppChain of your choice: 
1. Visit the [Bridge](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/bridge/?network=bas-mapes) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Testnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.

3. Choose a **From** and **To** network, enter a desired **Token amount**, and click **Approve** to allow the Bridge to access that amount.

4. Confirm the approval transaction in MetaMask.

5. Click **Send** to bridge tokens. Also, check the current network liquidity capacity to make sure it's more than what you're bridging.

6. Confirm the bridging transaction in MetaMask.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/confirm-bridging-in-metamask.jpg" alt="Click Confirm in MetaMask" class="responsive-pic" width="250" />
7. Click **Switch network** to continue.

8. Confirm the switching in MetaMask.

9. **Stay on the page** and wait a moment for the tokens to be auto-claimed in the destination network. When the **Claim** check is there, you'll see the "Bridge successful!" message and can **Close** the page.

### Recover non-finished bridging
Sometimes you may have a non-finished bridging. This may happen due to an OS crash, closed tab, lost internet connection, and many other reasons.
If you managed to **Send** tokens from the source network and confirm the bridging transaction (#6 in [**Bridge assets**](/app-chains/chainscanner/bridge/#bridge-assets)), you will have that transaction in your MetaMask history.

To recover a non-finished bridging:
1. In MetaMask, switch to the network you were bridging from and find the **Deposit Token** transaction from #5â€“6 in [**Bridge assets**](/app-chains/chainscanner/bridge/#bridge-assets). Copy this transaction hash.
2. Visit the [Bridge](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/bridge/?network=bas-mapes) (preselected meta-apes network).
3. Click **Finish bridge** above the **To** field.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/click-finish-bridge.jpg" alt="Click Finish bridge" class="responsive-pic" width="600" />
4. Choose the source **Network** as it was in the original bridging attempt, enter the transaction hash from #1, and click **Switch network** to auto-claim your tokens in the destination network. The switching action is equivalent to #7 in [**Bridge assets**](/app-chains/chainscanner/bridge/#bridge-assets).

## Key features

1. Create best-in-class NFT monetization strategies.
2. Effortlessly interact with contracts deployed on multiple blockchains.
3. Easily connect Web3 wallets (MetaMask) to authenticate and enable in-game transactions.
4. In-built kit to create responsive games on Android and iOS. 
5. Add blockchain interactivity to existing games. 

## Supported platforms

ANKR Unity SDK supports Android, iOS, WebGL, and Standalone platforms.

1. Android and iOS builds are using a deep link to connect with your wallet, such as MetaMask.

2. WebGL uses its own unique implementation because it uses a web browser plugin to connect to blockchain.

3. A standalone build requires scanning a QR Code to connect with your wallet, such as MetaMask. 
QR Code is generated by our SDK using the same composed ConnectURL.

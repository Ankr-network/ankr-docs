# Ankr Game

In recent years, the number of blockchain-based video games with active users has skyrocketed thanks to play-to-earn (P2E) value models and the success demonstrated by early Web3 gaming projects like Axie Infinity.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are of special relevance to game developers that want to include in-game currency. By implementing an NFT, in-game characters and items can be truly held by the player eliminating the possibility of losing acquired items due to lost login credentials or account termination. 

Today, the Web3 gaming industry is booming; it grew by [765% in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/01/25/does-blockchain-herald-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-for-gaming/?sh=10d21ecf6827). 

The biggest challenge to its continued adoption, however, is the technical difficulty involved with creating a Web3 game. Thatâ€™s where Ankr Game SDKs comes in. 

Ankr Game SDKs provide Web3 capabilities to the two biggest players in the industry - **Unity Engine** and **Unreal Engine**.

## Ankr Unity SDK

**Unity** is the most popular engine for independent developers and game studios.

The Unity Engine is a cross-platform game development suite that makes it easy to build your game once and then deploy it across all major mobile, VR, web, console, and TV platforms from a single script. You can install the engine from Unity Hub, choose the version you want and simply select the target platforms for your game. All the SDKs and other tools required for those platforms can be automatically downloaded by the Hub.

It is easier to get started as a game developer with Unity. C# is an easier language to learn and 
there is a huge and very active community of other developers and designers. The development process is faster with Unity and it is a popular choice with mobile game developers. 

It has everything you need to create a game from scratch. 

## Ankr Unreal SDK

**Unreal** is the more popular engine for the AAA-industry and artists. Developed by Epic Games, Unreal is the driving force behind blockbuster games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Fortnite.

The Unreal Engine is a cross-platform suite of game development tools but you are required to set up the engine for every platform (other than PC) you want to support. This includes installing the SDK and any other tools required to run the game on the target platform. Unreal is renowned for enabling fine-tuned graphics and lightning-fast render speeds. It is the better option for virtual reality integration and photorealistic picture quality. 

You can use blueprints like building blocks for simple prototyping, however C++ is required for more sophisticated game logic. It is a more complex language to learn but there are extensive tutorials and an active and responsive community for support. 

Unreal is the ideal choice for creating bigger budget, complex games with superb graphics and performance at scale.

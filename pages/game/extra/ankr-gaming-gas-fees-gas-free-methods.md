# Gas fees and gas-free methods

All the methods pertaining to smart contracts can be narrowed down to the methods that change the state of the contract and the methods that don’t.

Let’s have a look at the code of smart contracts and see what's the difference between those. Take the [ERC-721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/3aa7ff74b0ba3ea44fb4f55258f94595b93f8cd8/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) smart contract for example.

## No gas fee methods

`balanceOf` is a simple example of the method that doesn’t change a contract state.

```
function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {
...
}
```

All non-payable methods should be marked as `view`. Looking at ABI generated by this contract, we can see the `stateMutability` field with the `view` value.

```
{
    "constant": true,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "owner",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "name": "balanceOf",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
}
```

Read more on the View functions in [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/contracts.html#view-functions) docs.

To view a list of methods, call the [Contract.GetData](/game/unity/api-reference/contract/get-data) method.

Requesting data from contract fields or mappings is also gas free.

Let’s take a look at the [Simple Open Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/solidity-by-example.html#simple-open-auction) example from Solidity docs.

```
uint public auctionEndTime;
mapping(address => uint) public pendingReturns;
```

In ABI it looks the following way.

```
...
{
    "constant": true,
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "auctionEndTime",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
},
{
    "constant": true,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "name": "pendingReturns",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
}
...
```

To read more on Solidity features, follow the [mappings](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/types.html#mappings) and [fields](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/structure-of-a-contract.html#state-variables) links.

To access contract fields and mappings, use the [Contract.GetData](/game/unity/api-reference/contract/get-data) method.

## Gas fee methods

All methods that change a contract state and aren't marked as `view` require a gas fee to be paid for mining.

```
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) {
...
}
```

To check that, have a look at the `stateMutability` field of an ABI.

```
{
    "constant": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "to",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "tokenId",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "mint",
    "outputs": [],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  }
```

The `stateMutability` value can be either payable or non-payable for the gas fee methods.

To call that kind of contract methods, use [CallMethod](/game/unity/api-reference/contract/call-method) or [Web3SendMethod](/game/unity/api-reference/contract/web3-send-method).

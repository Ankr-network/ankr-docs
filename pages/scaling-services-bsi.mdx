# Bitcoin Secured Infrastructure

Bitcoin Secured Infrastructure is a supplementary framework or protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to improve its functionality, particularly in terms of scalability, transaction speed, cost, and security.

As a first step, Asphere forms a strategic alliance with [Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/) and offers launching your custom Bitcoin L2 chain that natively integrates with Babylon's network and Bitcoin Staking protocol that enhances the crypto-economic security of you chain, makes it a participant of the healthy economics, and provides a highly-scalable chain with fast finality for transactions.

Asphere's Bitcoin Secured Infrastructure provide the following security benefits to chains with Babylon's Bitcoin Timestamping protocol:

  * **Solves long-range attacks**: Bitcoin's immutability ensures that finalized PoS blocks cannot be tampered with after they are anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. This significantly reduces the risk of long-range attacks, where an attacker tries to rewrite the blockchain’s history by manipulating old blocks, as Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) makes such attacks extremely costly and unlikely.

  * **No weak subjectivity**: Bitcoin timestamps are objective. It can thus eliminate the dependency of PoS chains on social consensus and weak subjectivity.

  * **Shorter unbonding time**: By replacing social consensus, BTC timestamping can reduce the stake unbonding time of PoS chains from weeks to one day.

  * **New chain bootstrapping**: New PoS chains with low valuation are more vulnerable to forking attacks. BTC timestamping can help safeguard the chain alone its growth.

  * **Verification of state sync and snapshots**: The objective truth about a PoS chain provided by BTC allows the users of the PoS chain to verify the chain state or snapshot it has downloaded from the P2P network.

  * **Protecting important transactions**: BTC timestamps can be used to further confirm important PoS transactions at the cost of longer confirmation latency.

  * **Censorship Resistance**: BTC timestamping could also be used to fight against transaction censorship in PoS chains via posting censored transactions to BTC.

## Bitcoin Secured Infrastructure tech solution

Asphere offers a comprehensive suite of technical solutions designed to accelerate launching your custom Bitcoin L2 PoS chain:

  * **Cosmos SDK Template**: We offer a fully customizable template built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing developers to launch their own blockchain network quickly and start using it with an RPC URL.

  * **Babylon Integration**: Native integration with Babylon’s network and Bitcoin staking protocol via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol ensures that your PoS chain benefits from Bitcoin’s robust security. This integration provides fast finality for transactions and allows seamless interoperability with other blockchains, enhancing the overall security and scalability of your network.

  * **VM Flexibility**: Developers can choose between various Virtual Machine (VM) environments, such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or WebAssembly (WASM), based on the specific requirements of their project. This flexibility allows you to deploy smart contracts and other decentralized dApps with ease.

  * **Modules**: Asphere also offers optional modules like bridges and block explorers to enhance the capabilities of your network. Besides those common items, you have the vast list of modules to choose from:

    * **Auth**: Authentication of accounts and transactions for Cosmos SDK applications.
    * **Authz**: Authorization for accounts to perform actions on behalf of other accounts.
    * **Bank**: Token transfer functionalities.
    * **Bank v2**: Token transfer functionalities, enhanced.
    * **Circuit**: Circuit breaker module for pausing messages.
    * **Consensus** Consensus module for modifying CometBFT's ABCI consensus params.
    * **Distribution**: Fee distribution, and staking token provision distribution.
    * **Epochs**: Allow other modules to set that they would like to be signaled once every period.
    * **Evidence**: Evidence handling for double signing, misbehaviour, etc.
    * **Feegrant**: Grant fee allowances for executing transactions.
    * **Genutil**: Genesis utilities for the Cosmos SDK.
    * **Governance**: On-chain proposals and voting.
    * **Mint**: Creation of new units of staking token.
    * **NFT**: NFT module implemented based on ADR43.
    * **Params**: Globally available parameter store.
    * **Protocolpool**: Functionalities handling community pool funds.
    * **Slashing**: Validator punishment mechanisms.
    * **Staking**: Proof-of-Stake layer for public blockchains.
    * **Tx**: Tx utilities for the Cosmos SDK.
    * **Upgrade**: Software upgrades handling and coordination.
    * **Validate**: Global ante/post handlers and tx validator setup.

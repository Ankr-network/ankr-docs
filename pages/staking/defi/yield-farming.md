# Yield farming
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see dashboard where you can enable the **Farming** filter. 

This filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit providing liquidity on DEXs and getting rewards in the LP tokens which you can then farm.

Liquidity pairs in the listed yield farming pools usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token.
Rewards are usually given in the LP token native to the DEX. For example, CAKE on PancakeSwap.

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a pool:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the pool.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, choose a pool if there are multiple pools listed, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity
To withdraw liquidity from a pool:
1. On the page of the pool, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

### Yield farm
To yield farm your LP tokens:
1. On the page of the pool, claim your rewards â€” the liquid pool tokens rewarded you for providing liquidity to the pool (usually, via a dedicated **Rewards** tab). 
2. Stake your LP tokens and gain yield (usually, via the **Stake** button on a dedicated **Stake LP** tab or **Deposit & Stake** button on the main pool page).  

### Withdraw yield-farming rewards
To withdraw your LP tokens along with the yield gains:
1. On the page of the pool, withdraw your LP tokens (usually, via the **Withdraw** button on a dedicated **Stake LP** tab or **Withdraw** button on the main pool page).

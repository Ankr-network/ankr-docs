## Delegated Staking
Currently, no integration options are available for Delegated Staking. Stay tuned for future releases!

## Liquid Staking 
You can integrate with Ankr Liquid Staking through:  
* [Liquid Staking SDK](/staking/for-integrators/sdk/liquid-staking-sdk/) — a more convenient option with wider access and more conventional methods naming. 
* [Smart Contracts API](/staking/for-integrators/smart-contract-api/overview/) — direct access to our Liquid Staking smart contracts.
  * [RESTful API for Liquid Staking metrics](/staking/for-integrators/restful-api/staking-metrics/) — addition to the smart contracts API to get richer statistical data.
  * [REFTful API for validators](/staking/for-integrators/restful-api/validator-api/) — addition to the smart contracts API to get such data as unbond time for rewards and amount of released rewards per validator. 

## Oracles 
Oracles can provide you with data from DEXs and make integrating with Ankr Staking easier.
They obtain live data such as prices of Ankr Liquid Tokens to US Dollar and so on.

Curently, you can integrate with:
* [PancakeSwap Price Oracle](/staking/for-integrators/oracles/pancakeswap-oracle/)

## Liquid Crowdloan
You can integrate Liquid Crowdloan into Parachain Crowdloan on Polkadot through our [Liquid Crowdloan SDK](/docs/staking/for-integrators/sdk/liquid-crowdloan-sdk/).

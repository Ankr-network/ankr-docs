# Liquid Crowdloan SDK

Ankr’s new Software Development Kit (SDK) integrates Parachain Liquid Crowdloan into Parachain Crowdloan.

Ankr has developed an [ SDK ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ankr.com/stakefi-polkadot) that works with smart contracts and the Polkadot wallet extension to provide a smooth, hassle-free user experience for projects willing to integrate Parachain Liquid Bonding, such as [Bounce Finance](https://bounce.finance), [OnX Finance](https://onx.finance), and [Clover Finance](https://clover.finance).

The Parachain Crowdloan SDK is connected by default with the Web 3.0 key provider hence removing the need to connect to it manually.

Projects can connect to Ankr’s Parachain Liquid Crowdloan SDK and get basic information without ever connecting to Polkadot.js.

For example:

* a list of available crowdloans,
* a request deposit address for their selected crowdloan.

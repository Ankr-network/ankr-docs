# FTM staking mechanics

FTM Liquid Staking lets the user stake their funds through the corresponding smart contracts on the Fantom network, accumulate rewards, and receive their stake and rewards when unstaking.

The following section explains staking requirements, fees, rewards, validators, smart contracts and function calls to interact with these smart contracts.


## Requirements

The requirements when staking are:

* Minimum value to stake (minimumStake) — 1 FTM.

* Maximum value to stake — unlimited, at the user’s discretion. 

The requirements when unstaking are:

* Minimum value to unstake — from 0 FTM.

* Maximum value to unstake — staked amount + % of the reward, up to the user’s balance.

* Release time — up to 35 days.


## Fees
When staking, the user pays no fees.

Unstaknig applies a `burnFee` that depends on the current liquidity and amount to unstake, and is calculated by the `FantomPool` smart contract. 
The fee is deducted from the withdrawn amount.

The user must also count in the gas price for outgoing transactions.


## Rewards

Validators receive rewards on the regular basis. The exact time is to be updated soon.

The APY is dynamic and calculated from the validators' rewards.   


## Validators
The validator set consists of one [Fantom](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x0aa7aa665276a96acd25329354feea8f955caf2b), one [MCLB-DAO](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x63c87103063a146d75788780f2b026a01c03046b), and one [Ankr](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x146ee71e057e6b10efb93aedf631fde6cbaed5e2) validator.


## Smart contracts
Smart contracts and addresses involved in FTM Liquid Staking are:

[FantomPool](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x84db6eE82b7Cf3b47E8F19270abdE5718B936670) — contract on Fantom Chain where the user sends their initial staking or unstaking request.

[aFTMb](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xB42bF10ab9Df82f9a47B86dd76EEE4bA848d0Fa2) — contract on Fantom Chain that mints or burns aBNBb tokens for the user in 1:1 ratio with the staked amount.

FantomStub — contract that delegates stakes to a validator from the validator set. The contract is needed to avoid Fantom intrinsic restrictions. The address is not given, as the user never directly interacts with the contract.

[Operator address](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x4069d8a3de3a72eca86ca5e0a4b94619085e7362) — address of the Ankr backend on Fantom Chain that

## Staking workflow
The workflow is both user and Ankr-driven. The user part is Step 1, the Ankr part is Steps 2–3.

1. User calls the function `FantomPool::stake()` payable on the Fantom network. The function is payable, so the user needs to specify the amount to stake. The amount must meet the `minimumStake` requirement, which is returned by the function `FantomPool::getMinimumStake() public view returns (uint256)`. 

2. If the transaction is successful, aFTMbs are automatically minted to the user’s address. Also an event `FantomPool::StakeReceived(stakerAddressIndexed, amountMinted)` is emitted. The event can later be found using the `stakerAddressIndexed` parameter. User can later look up their aFTMb balance in the `aFTMb` contract. 

4. Then the Ankr backend sends the staked funds to the `FantomStub` contract and delegates the funds to a validator from the validator set to gain rewards. The validator set consists of one [Fantom](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0xd160d9b59508e4636eec3e0a7f734268d1ce1047), one [MCLB-DAO](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x63c87103063a146d75788780f2b026a01c03046b), and one [Ankr](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x146ee71e057e6b10efb93aedf631fde6cbaed5e2) validator.

5. Currently, the Ankr backend does not monitor events on the blockchain, but instead uses cron for scheduled checks: once an hour for funds, delegating, updating ratio, etc.

## Unstaking worklfow

The workflow is both user and Ankr-driven. The user part is Step 1, the Ankr part is Steps 2–3.

1. User calls `aFTMb::function burn(uint256 amount)`. 

2. If the transaction is successful, aFTMbs are automatically burned and removed from the user’s address. An event `TokensBurned(address indexed account, uint256 amount, uint256 shares, uint256 burnFee, uint256 indexed wrId)` is emitted, and the user receives `amount - burnFee` FTM within the period of up to 35 days. 
The fee depends on unstaked amount and can be shown to the user via `getBurnFee(uint256 amount) external view returns (uint256)`, which changes from time to time based on the current available liquidity. 

3. Then `FantomPool` saves the request in the form of a `WithdrawalRequest {address payable staker; uint256 amount;}` struct.  Within up to 35 days the Ankr backend calls `withdrawLast()` to send the staked funds back to the user, and a `Withdrawn(address indexed staker, uint256 amount, uint256 indexed wrId)` event is emitted.

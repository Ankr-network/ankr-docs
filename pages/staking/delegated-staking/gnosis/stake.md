# Stake mGNO token

To stake mGNO, you'll need to:
1. Purchase GNO on Ethereum.
2. Bridge GNO to Gnosis.
3. Swap the bridged GNO to mGNO.
4. Connect your wallet at Ankr Staking.
5. Stake mGNO at Ankr.

## Before you start

<Callout>
Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a MetaMask wallet.
</Callout>

## Purchase GNO
Visit one of the [recommended DEXs](https://docs.gnosischain.com/ecosystems/defi#dex-aggregators) and swap your assets for the desired amount of GNO tokens.

<Callout>
xDai

You'll need a small amount of xDai for gas fees while depositing GNO and staking mGNO.
</Callout>

## Bridge purchased GNO to Gnosis Chain

Your obtained GNO is likely to be the Ethereum Mainnet GNO version.
To use it on Gnosis, you'll need to bridge it to Gnosis Chain.

* Use the [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) to move GNO from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain.
* Add Gnosis to your wallet, visiting [Ankr Gnosis RPC page](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/gnosis/) and clicking **Add network**. Alternatively, use [these manual instructions](https://docs.gnosischain.com/tools/wallets/metamask) from Gnosis.

## Swap the bridged GNO to mGNO

<Callout>
Gas fees and liquidity restrictions

Make sure you have some xDai to pay the gas fee for your depositing transaction.

Remember that mGNO will remain locked and illiquid until ~Q4 2023 max.
This is due to Gnosis plans to enable withdrawals in the Shanghai upgrade. Shanghai is planned in 6‚Äì12 months from The Merge that is expected in ~Q3/Q4 2022.

The [original Gnosis deposit instructions](https://docs.gnosischain.com/node/validator-deposits#convert-gno-to-mgno-special-cases) contain a **wrong link** in **Step 1**, so read the fixed version below.

To swap your bridged GNO: 
1. Go to https://gbc-deposit-old.herokuapp.com/ and connect your web3 wallet toGnosis on the application.
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Select the **Swap** tab. Enter the amount you would like to convert and click **Convert**. You can convert any amount, be sure to start with a leading 0 to convert less than 1 GNO. For example, 0.1 GNO will be converted to 3.2 mGNO.
4. Sign 2 transactions in your wallet. The first is a free signature request to allow the application to make the conversion. The second processes the transaction. This will require a small amount of xDai to complete.
5. The transaction should be initiated and completed within a few seconds. Once completed you can click the link to see the tx in BlockScout and add mGNO to your MetaMask wallet. The mGNO contract address is 0x722fc4DAABFEaff81b97894fC623f91814a1BF68.

When done, you're ready to stake your mGNO at Ankr.

## Stake mGNO

<Callout>
Micropool and gas fees

Your stake does not immediately gets staked on Gnosis. 
Gnosis accepts stakes with minumum 1 GNO (32 mGNO).
To bypass this and accept your stake if it's lower than 1 GNO, we created a micropool that accumulates user stakes.
Once it has 1 GNO, we stake it with Gnosis.

Make sure you have some xDai to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

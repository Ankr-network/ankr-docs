### Are there any risks from staking, like slashing or penalties?
The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. 
Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline.
To avoid looses of staked mGNO we made insurance system, each Node Provider has insurance pool with locked mGNO. 
This mGNO will be used to cover provider's slashing.

###  Where can I get mGMO? 
As getting mGMO is a multistep process, you're better off reading how to get it in the [mGMO staking guide](/staking/delegated-staking/mgno/stake/).

### What is the minimum and maximum amount of mGNO I can stake?
* Minimum — 0.00001 mGNO.
* Maximum — limited by the specific Node Provider capacity (count of supported keys by the provider, each key allows to stake 32 mGNO).

### Is my mGNO staked immediately?
Gnosis accepts stakes with minumum 1 GNO (32mGNO).
To bypass this and accept your stake if it's lower than 1GNO, we created a micropool that accumulates user stakes.
Once it has 1 GNO, we stake it with Gnosis.

This is why your stake may have to wait a while, until it's really staked with Gnosis.

### What if I want to stake more after already staking some mGNO?
You're limited only by the capaticy of a specific Node Provider.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards? 
Rewards accumulate on the daily basis.

### When can I claim my rewards?
Currently, claiming rewards is not available, as this functionality is not yet supported by Gnosis.
It will be enabled after in the Shanghai upgrade that will follow The Merge in 6-12 moths.
Overall, it looks like Shanghai is going to come in ~Q2/Q3 2023.

### When can I unstake?
Currently, unstaking is not available, as this functionality is not yet supported by Gnosis.
Unstaking will be enabled after in the Shanghai upgrade that will follow The Merge in 6-12 moths.
Overall, it looks like Shanghai is going to come in ~Q2/Q3 2023.

### Can I stake with Ledger if I connect it with MetaMask?
Yes, you can.

### Must rewards be claimed from the Ankr website, or will they be automatically sent to the supplying wallet?
Rewards must be claimed from the [Ankr website](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/) after the Ethereum Shangai upgrade in ~Q2/Q3 2023.

# Claim or restake rewards

## Before you start

Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a [MetaMask wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed and set up in Chrome.

## Claim rewards
<Callout type="info">
You can claim or restake your rewards after the locking period of 84–91 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently.<br/>
However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.<br/>
Rewards accrue on the weekly basis, i.e. you can claim rewards once a week, not daily. 
</Callout>

### Claim all rewards
You may not want to restake your rewards and may want to claim all unlocked rewards at once. To do that:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/).
2. Locate **ANKR** under **Staked tokens** and click **Manage**.

## Restake rewards
<Callout type="info">
For each of your restaking transactions, you'll be able to claim or, in turn, restake your rewards after the locking period of 84–91 days. This period applies to each restaking transaction independently.<br/>
However, your restake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.
</Callout>

You can restake your rewards to increase you APY. To do that:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/).
2. Locate **ANKR** under **Staked tokens** and click **Manage**.
   <img src="/docs/staking/delegated-staking/ankr/click-manage.jpg" alt="Locate ANKR and click Manage" class="responsive-pic" width="900" />

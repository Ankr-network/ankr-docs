## Stake ANKR

<Callout>
Make sure you have some ETH to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

Currently, **ANKR can only be staked on Ethereum**. If you have ANKR on any other chains, please bridge it first to stake it. 

You can claim or restake your rewards after the locking period of 84â€“91 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently.
However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.

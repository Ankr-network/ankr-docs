## Stake ANKR
<Callout type="info">
Currently, **ANKR can only be staked on Ethereum**. If you have ANKR on any other chains, please bridge it first to stake it.<br/>
Before staking, make sure you have some ETH to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.<br/>
You can claim or restake your rewards after the locking period of 84–91 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently.<br/>
However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.

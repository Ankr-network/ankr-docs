## Liquid Staking
[Liquid Staking](/staking/liquid-staking/overview/) extends the Staking experience to solve the problem of loss of liquidity and capital inefficiency. 
When assets are staked, they are usually locked up on-chain helping to maintain the network. 
However, Liquid Staking provides instant access to Liquid Staking tokens that are equivalent in value to the stake in a 1:1 ratio. 
These portable Liquid Staking tokens, such as aMATICc, aETHc, and more, can be utilized on additional DeFi platforms to earn further rewards or instantly swap them for other assets.

The clear benefits of Ankr Liquid Staking are: 
* Minimum commitment costs
* Immediate access to liquidity
* Transfer of risks to Ankr experts

## Delegate Staking
[Delegate Staking](/staking/delegated-staking/ankr/overview/) extends the Liquid Staking experience to make it more decentralized and transparent. 
Instead of relying solely on a limited subset of validators, users will be able to choose from a larger range of validators to stake with, and validators will be able to choose incentives and their amount to stimulate users to stake with them.
This is a next step towards Ankr 2.0.


## DeFi
[Ankr DeFi](/staking/defi/overview/) features a cross-chain dashboard where users can choose Liquid Staking tokens and assets to trade, earn additional yeild, and platforms to do it on.


## Ankr Bridge
[Ankr Bridge](/staking/bridge/overview/) is a product for bridging assets between networks. 
It enables users to bring their Liquid Staking Tokens to other networks where they may have more exciting yield opportunities.

Ankr Bridge is secured with ECDSA cryptography and a multi-party computation based Threshold Signature Scheme. This ensures that private keys are never exposed whilst mitigating against any single point of failure.


## Ankr Switch
[Ankr Switch](/staking/switch/overview/) enables the exchange of Liquid Staking tokens: between reward earning tokens and reward bearing tokens for the same asset.


## Parachain Liquid Crowdloan
[Parachain Liquid Crowdloan](/staking/liquid-crowdloan/overview/) provide benefits similar to Staking and allows users to:
1. Bond DOT/KSM: users bond DOT or KSM to a Polkadot project during a Parachain Slot Auction. 
2. Locked Liquidity: if the project wins a slot, the bonded DOT or KSM is inaccessible.
3. Attain Instant Liquidity: however, Parachain Liquid Staking tokens can be instantly obtained. These are portable and usable elsewhere. 

Token rewards from the winning project are distributed to Parachain Liquid Crowdloan token holders automatically.

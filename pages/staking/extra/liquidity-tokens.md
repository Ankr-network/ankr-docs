# Types of Liquid Staking tokens

There are two types of Liquid Staking tokens:

• Reward Bearing Tokens, e.g. aETHc formerly aETH
• Reward Earning Tokens, e.g. aAVAXb and aETHb (formerly fETH.)

## Reward earning
These are automatically issued to your Ankr Staking Dashboard upon successful ETH2 staking.

The amount of aETHc issued is equivalent to the amount of staked ETH.

Reward bearing tokens represents the amount of ETH staked at issuance PLUS future staking rewards.

At the end of the ETH2 staking period (when the beacon chain merges with the mainnet), aETHc holders can redeem aETHc for their original ETH stake plus all accumulated staking rewards.

### Fair falue & market price
Market price is distinct from Fair Value.

Fair Value is your stake plus the rewards that have not yet been distributed. This will be received when ETH is unstaked (this is expected to be some time in 2022). 

The Market Price is the price that traders are willing to buy and sell internet bonds knowing that they don't have access to the Fair Value until 2022. 

## Reward earning tokens
These are automatically issued to your Ankr Staking Dashboard upon successful ETH2 and/or AVAX staking.

Daily rewards are automatically updated in Bond holders’ wallets. The amount of aETHb/aAVAX held automatically increases with every daily rebase.

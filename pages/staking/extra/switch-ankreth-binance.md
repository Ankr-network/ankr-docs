# Switching ankrETH on BNB Chain

We are decommissioning an [older version of the ankrETH](https://bscscan.com/token/0x973616ff3b9d8f88411c5b4e6f928ee541e4d01f) Liquid Staking token on the BNB Chain and switching to a [new ankrETH](https://bscscan.com/token/0xe05a08226c49b636acf99c40da8dc6af83ce5bb3) token that is compatible with Ankr Bridge.

The reason is Binance stopped supporting an older ETH bridged version and part of our users got their older ankrETH locked because of that.

To switch to the new ankrETH: 
1. In your wallet, switch the account with the locked ankrETH and change the network option to Binance Smart Chain. 
2. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/). Ankr will ask you to connect your wallet if you haven't done it before.

3. Locate the "unsupported old version" of ankrETH and click **Switch to new**.<br />

     If you forgot to change to Binance Smart Chain at Step 1, you may need to reconnect your wallet after changing to it.

4. Confirm the switching transaction in your wallet. <br />

5. After confirming the transaction, wait for it to finalize. <br />

6. When the transaction is finalized and switching is successful, click **Go to dashboard** to see the new ankrETH. 
   You can also  add it to your wallet clicking **Add ankrETH to wallet**. <br />

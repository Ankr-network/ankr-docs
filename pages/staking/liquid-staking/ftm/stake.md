6. Click **Go to dashboard** to see your stake. You may need to wait a little for the transaction to finalize and the dashboard to automatically update. 


You will need to make the following interactions in your wallet:

üëç**Authorize** to confirm the connection.

üëç **Confirm** the transaction.

Your aFTMb balance automatically increases by a small amount, daily, to reflect your Fantom Staking rewards, while your aFTMc amount never changes but grows in value to FTM overtime.  

You can now use your aFTMb reward earning tokens to earn additional layers of rewards on other DeFi platforms listed in [**DeFi**](https://ankr.com/staking/defi/) under the aFTMb section.

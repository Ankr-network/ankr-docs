### Which wallets are compatible with the aFTMb/aFTMc tokens?

aFTMb/aFTMc is an ERC-20 token that is compatible with Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask.


### Are there any docs about the FTM staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

Yes — there is a [user guide](/staking/liquid-staking/ftm/stake).


### What is the minimum amount of FTM I can stake?
 
1 FTM.


### Is there a maximum amount I can stake?

No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited.  


### How long does it take to unstake my FTM?

You receive the unstaked FTM after the unbonding period of up to 35 days.


### How do I receive rewards? 

aFTMb is a rebasing token. When holding aFTMb, your balance will increase in proportion to your FTM staking rewards. 
A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. 
So each day, you will see the quantity of your aFTMb increase by a small amount. 

aFTMc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. 
Instead, it appreciates in value, as the redemption ratio grows because of reward accumulation.


### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

aFTMb will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. 
aFTMc rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as aFTMc grows in value to FTM.


### Does Ankr charge for the service?

When unstaking, users pay a burn fee that depends on the current liquidity and amount to unstake.


### What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aFTMb?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to.
Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.
 
### If I click **Unstake**, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?

Your stake immediately **stops** accumulating rewards once you clicked **Unstake**.

### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

If a validator node acts maliciously, delegators will also be slashed as this is an essential part of the Fantom network’s security.  
Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

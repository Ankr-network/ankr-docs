We seized active support of Kusama Liquid Staking. There are no new stakes getting aKSMb.

However, your old stakes keep generating you rewards.

## Don't see your aKSMb balance?
If you have staked before we discontinued active Kusama support and don't see your aKSMb balance in your wallet:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard).
2. Find your liquid staking token, click the three-dot menu, and click **Token information**.
3. Click **Add aKSMb to wallet**.

<Callout type="success">
You can also manually import the token in your wallet and copy&paste the **Contract** address while doing it.

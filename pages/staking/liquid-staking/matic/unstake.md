## Overview

If you decide to unstake, the waiting period will depend on what network you chose when staking:
* For MATIC Liquid Staking on Ethereum, it can take up to 3-4 days before you can claim your funds. Throughout this period, your MATIC will continue to **earn staking rewards**.
* For MATIC Liquid Staking on Polygon, the unstake is fast, as what happens is your Liquid Staking token gets swapped for MATIC in a liquidity pool on Polygon.

If you're unstaking on Ethereum, ensure you have 0.025 ETH for the unstake fee.  

Unstaking MATIC tokens on Ethereum is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the MATIC smart-contracts deployed in Ethereum.

MATIC tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

If you're unstaking on Polygon, a fee of 0.5% is deducted from the unstaking amount.

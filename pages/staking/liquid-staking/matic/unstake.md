## Release time

If you decide to unstake, the waiting period will depend on what network you chose when staking:
* For MATIC Liquid Staking on Ethereum, it can take up to 3-4 days before you can claim your funds. Throughout this period, your MATIC will continue to **earn staking rewards**.
* For MATIC Liquid Staking on Polygon, the unstake is fast, as what happens is your Liquid Staking token gets swapped for MATIC in a liquidity pool on Polygon.

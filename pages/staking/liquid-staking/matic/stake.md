### Stake your MATIC
<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have a small surplus of FTM to pay the gas fees for the staking transaction.<br/>
Normally, it is around 0.0005 ETH, but may vary depending on the transaction complexity and network transaction load.

1. Visit [Ankr Staking](https://www.ankr.com/staking/stake). 
2. Locate the **Polygon (MATIC)** box and click **Stake** in it.

<Callout type="success">
To reflect your staking rewards, your aMATICb balance automatically increases by a small amount, daily, and your aMATICc keeps growing in price to FTM, never changing in number.<br/>

### Are there any docs about the ETH staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

The docs are under development and will soon be released.

### Does Ankr charge for the service?

ANKR does not charge any service fees for SSV Trustless Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a fee deducted from your rewards, representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders.

### How do I receive rewards?

asETHc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. Instead, it appreciates in value in relation to ETH, so the redemption price of 1 asETHc will grow over time because of reward accumulation.  

Mind that to pull out your rewards, you’ll need to sell asETHc, for example, on Ankr DeFi, as Ethereum hasn’t implemented the unstaking functionality yet.

### How long does it take to unstake my ETH?

Currently, there is no unbonding period, as there is no unstaking for ETH. This functionality is to be implemented by the Ethereum team in future updates.

### Is SSV Trustless Liquid Staking available on Ethereum MainNet?

No, currently SSV Trustless Liquid Staking is only available on Goerli Ethereum Testnet. A Mainnet release is coming later.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

asETHc will increase in value only, daily. asETHc rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as asETHc grows in value to ETH.

### Is there a maximum amount I can stake?

No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited. You should know that currently staking starts once 32 ETH are accumulated, so if your stake is > 32 ETH, it’ll be divided into chunks and the rule will apply to each of them.

### Is there any liquidity for my Liquid Staking tokens anywhere?

So far as SSV Trustless Liquid is only available on Ethereum TestNet, there are limited liquidity for asETHc.  

  

The liquidity will raise when SSV releases a MainNet version.

### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline. The delegated staked ETH is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. 

### What determines the appreciation of asETHc?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much ETH is validated on the network. The less ETH is staked, the higher the rewards to incentivize more ETH to come online, and vice versa.

### What is the change interval to increase my stake?

0.5 ETH. It means you can stake 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 ETH, but cannot stake, for example, 0.55, 1.1, 1.88 ETH.

### Can I use cold wallets for staking?

Yes, you can use Ledger Nano cold wallets through MetaMask. Visit the Ledger's [guide on connecting Ledger through MetaMask](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask).

# How to stake ETH in SSV–Ethereum

As SSV Trustless Liquid Staking is currently available on Ethereum Goerli, you'll be staking Testnet tokens.  

## Get ETH

As Goerli is a testing network, you can get Goerli ETH from a Goerli faucet, such as [Goerlifaucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).
More faucets can easily be found on Internet. 

## Connect your wallet

<Callout type="tip">

**STAKING GAS FEE**<br/>
Make sure you have enough ETH to cover the gas fees for you transactions.<br/>
Also, remember that Ethereum currently doesn't support unstaking. You will only be able to unstake with the Shanghai upgrade which is planned for ~Q2/Q3 2023.

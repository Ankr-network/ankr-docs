* You have a [MetaMask wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed and set up in Chrome.

## Get AVAX
There are several ways how to buy AVAX tokens:

1. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* Buy AVAX on a centralized exchange
* Withdraw **AVAX** to **AVAX C-Chain**

2. Centralized exchanges NOT supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* Go to [https://wallet.avax.network/](https://wallet.avax.network)

* From the left menu, select "**Cross-Chain**

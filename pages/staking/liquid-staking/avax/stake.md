## Use a supported browser extension with the Avalanche network

The choice is up to you. We recommend using Chrome Browser and MetaMask wallet extension.

## Get AVAX tokens to stake

There are several ways how to buy AVAX tokens:

1. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* Buy AVAX on a centralized exchange
* Withdraw **AVAX** to **AVAX C-Chain**

2. Centralized exchanges NOT supporting withdrawals to AVAX C-Chain

* If the exchange you are using does not support AVAX C-Chain, you must withdraw to **AVAX X-Chain** address using [AVAX Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network).

* Go to [https://wallet.avax.network/](https://wallet.avax.network)

* From the left menu, select "**Cross-Chain**

* Choose the '**C Chain (Contract)** as the destination chain

* Enter the amount you would like to transfer, and then click '**Confirm'**

3. Use [**Avalanche Bridge**](https://bridge.avax.network/login) 

Get free AVAX to trade on decentralized exchange on the Avalanche network.

1. Transfer tokens through [Avalanche Bridge](https://bridge.avax.network/login) using your MetaMask browser extension (Ethereum network).
2. Once you transferred tokens to Avalanche network using Avalanche Bridge, make sure that your MetaMask browser extension is connected using Avalanche network.
3. Sell the token that you bridged from Ethereum to Avalanche network in a decentralized exchange on Avalanche network. For example, [Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange), [Lydia Finance](https://www.lydia.finance), or [TraderJoe](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/).

### Send AVAX

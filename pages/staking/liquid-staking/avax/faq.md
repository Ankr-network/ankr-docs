### Which wallets are compatible with the aAVAXb/aAVAXc tokens?

aAVAXb/aAVAXc is an ERC-20 token that is compatible with Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask.


### Are there any docs about the AVAX staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?

Yes — there is a [user guide](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/avax/stake-avax).


### What is the minimum amount of AVAX I can stake?
 
1 AVAX.


### Is there a maximum amount I can stake?

No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited.  


### How long does it take to unstake my AVAX?

You receive the unstaked AVAX after the unbonding period, which is at end of the current validating period. A validating period is 4 weeks.


### How do I receive rewards? 

aAVAXb is a rebasing token. When holding aAVAXb, your balance will increase in proportion to your AVAX staking rewards. 
A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. 
So each day, you will see the quantity of your aAVAXb increase by a small amount. 

aAVAXc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. 
Instead, it appreciates in value, as the redemption ratio grows because of reward accumulation.

### How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

aAVAXb will increase in number with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. 
aAVAXc rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as aAVAXc grows in value to AVAX.


### Does Ankr charge for the service?

2% commission on the reward. 


### What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aAVAXb?

Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to.
Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.
 

### If I click **Unstake**, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?

Your stake **continues** to accumulate rewards until the moment you receive them.


### Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. 
Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction, attacks the network, or goes offline. 
The delegated staked AVAX is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. 
Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.

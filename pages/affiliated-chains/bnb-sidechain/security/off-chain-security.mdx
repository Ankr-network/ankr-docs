# Off-chain security

To bring the off-chain security, we're working on L2 solutions that are going to post state proofs in the BNB Smart Chain's original chain.
Also, the native asset bridge that we're developing will bring the block header verification function to proof if validator transition between different epochs is correct.

Once BNB Smart Chain teams introduce fast-finality to the Parlia consensus engine, it'll be also merged into BNB Sidechain to bring fast finalization of the produced blocks.

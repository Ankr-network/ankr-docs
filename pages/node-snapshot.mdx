# Blockchain Node Snapshots

Ankr has partnered with [Storj](https://www.storj.io/) to provide the community with easy access to the blockchain state snapshots used in nodes syncing by our Infrastructure engineering teams.

**Chains supported**:

  * Ethereum
  * Polygon
  * BNB Smart Chain

Find the full list of available snapshots [here](https://www.chainsnap.io/).

## Snapshot download

**Prerequisites**:

  * Uplink CLI (for downloading from Storj)
  * Tar (for inline decompression)

**Download and install Uplink**:

  * AMD64 see below, for other OS — see [here](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/downloads/download-uplink-cli):
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/storj/storj/releases/latest/download/uplink_linux_amd64.zip -o uplink_linux_amd64.zip
unzip -o uplink_linux_amd64.zip
sudo install uplink /usr/local/bin/uplink
```

**Download a chain snapshot**:

  1. At [chainsnap.io](https://www.chainsnap.io/), scroll down to the **Available Snapshots** list.  
     From here, there are two flows currently at work:
       * **Buy Now** — click to proceed to payment that ends up by receiving an access token from Storj.
       * **Request Download** — click to submit a request filling in your email that will be used to send you the payment link.

  2. Pay through the Storj portal to receive the access token required to download a snapshot.

  3. Use the inline multithread download that unTARs to your target directory (does not require double the hard drive space):

```shell
uplink cp --parallelism 16 --access '<PROVIDED_ACCESS_GRANT>' sj://chains/snapshot.tar.zst - | tar -xv --use-compress-program=zstd -C ~/chain/data
```

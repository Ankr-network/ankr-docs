# Check if a user complied with a policy

Ankr Verify features a policy verification check-up.
Calling the `exist()` function and providing it a policy ID, you can check if a specific policy has been successfully verified on the Ankr's side.
In other words, if a user has successfully complied with a policy.

[PolicyRegistry](https://testnet.opbnbscan.com/address/0xc492E85779BdCCEC18A099C6d8C2c9A3F74C94C5) (0xc492E85779BdCCEC18A099C6d8C2c9A3F74C94C5) — allows the user to check if a policy has been verified on the Ankr Verify's side.

### Functions
#### `exist(address user, uint256 id) returns (bool)`
Checks if a specific policy has been successfully verified on the Ankr's side.

##### Parameters
* `user` (address) — address of a vendor to check.
* `id` (uint256) — policy ID.

##### Response
The function returns a boolean: `true` if the policy has been verified and `false` if not.

##### Example
As a read function, you can call exist() anytime and check the result.

#### Usage Example
```
contract DAPP {
   IPoliciesRegistry policyRegistry;
   uint256 policyId;
   bool isExecuted;

   modifier onlyVerified(){
       require(policyRegistry.exist(msg.sender, policyId), "DAPP: user is not verified");
       _;
   }

   function execute() external onlyVerified {
       isExecuted = true;
   }
}
```

### Functions
#### `pub fn get_policy(ctx: Context<PolicyReturn>) -> Result<Policy>`
Checks if a specific policy has been successfully verified on the Ankr's side.

##### Accounts
###### Input
```
PolictyReturn:
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct PolicyReturn<'info> {
   pub account: Account<'info, Policy>,
}
```

To derive the `pub` that is passed in the `PolicyReturn` account, you can rely on example:
```
To get policy verification you need to pass needed PDA inside the PolicyReturn struct. PDA can be derived from user pubkey and policy id.
Example:
[PDA] = anchor.web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
   [
       user.toBuffer(),
       policy_id.toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8)
   ],
   policyRepo.programId
);
```

###### Output
The function returns:
```
Policy:
#[account]
pub struct Policy {
   pub cid: String,
   pub policy_id: u64,
   pub user: Pubkey,
}
```

##### Example
You can call the function anytime and check the result.

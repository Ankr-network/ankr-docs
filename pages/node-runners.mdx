# Node Runners

## Node requirements

### Ethereum

Requirements for an Ethereum node with an HTTP interface can be divided into the following types:

  * [Node hardware and network](/node-runners/#node-hardware-and-network).
  * [Node HTTP interface](/node-runners/#node-http-interface).
  * [Node location](/node-runners/#node-location).

#### Node hardware and network

Ethereum Mainnet archive nodes:

  * Recommended client — Erigon.
  * Erigon client hardware recommendation:
    * Storage: 3TB storage space: 2.2TB state (as of March 2023)
    * RAM: 32GB
    * CPU: 16 cores
    * Required interfaces: HTTP

Ethereum Mainnet full nodes:

  * Recommended client — Geth.
  * Geth client hardware recommendation:
    * Storage: 5TB storage space: 4.4TB state (as of March 2023)
    * RAM: 128GB
    * CPU: 16 cores
    * Required interfaces: HTTP

#### Node HTTP interface

   * Access via domain, not IP-address is desirable.
   * Only standard ports are acceptable (80 for HTTP scheme and 443 for HTTPS scheme).
   * Preferably allow access by HTTPS scheme, SSL certificate should be issued and managed by node providers themselves, we won’t be doing that.

#### Node location

A node can be deployed in any region. A node runner has to provide us with following data:
  * Country, Continent, City
  * Reverse proxy

The Node must be accessed through a reverse proxy for the following reasons:

  * Ensure Node’s interfaces are accessible on port 443.
  * Secure the connection with SSL certificates.
  * [Optional] Limit access to the node by incorporating random characters or an API KEY into the path.
Sample of the URL structure:
`https://your.domain.com/<path>/<api-key>`

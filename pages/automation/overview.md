Building with Ankr Automation will help you get to market faster and save you time and money on setup, maintenance, and risk costs.

## Available triggers

Ankr Automation will execute smart contract functions based on various triggers.

* Time-based triggers, allowing you to execute a contract function on a schedule of your choice. Your contract doesn't need to be compatible with `AutomationInterface`.
* Custom logic triggers, allowing you to execute a contract function on a certain event. Your contract needs to be compatible with `AutomationInterface`.

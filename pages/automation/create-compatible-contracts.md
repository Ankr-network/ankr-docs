# Create compatible contracts

Contract that are compatible with the `IAutomateCompatible` Ankr interface allow you to create custom logic tasks and automate contract function execution based on that logic.

A compatible contract contains:
1. A checker, that repeatedly checks on an event.
2. A follow-up executor, that contains the custom logic and executes it when the checker returnss `true`. 

## `IAutomateCompatible` interface
The interface contains a checker `checkTask()` and an executor with the custom logic `performTask()`.

## Example contract
To use the custom logic option in Ankr Automation, your contract must meet the following requirements:
* Inherit the `IAutomateCompatible` interface.
* Use the `IAutomateCompatible` interface in the way that is compatible with Ankr Automation.
* Implement the function `checkTask()` that will be executed off-chain to see if the logic in `performTask()` needs to be executed.
* Implement the `performTask()` that will be executed on-chain when `checkTask()` returns `true`.

Following these requirements, our example contract will increase a counter after every `interval` seconds.
If you register this contract as a Task in Ankr Automation, the Automation simulates `checkTask` off-chain during every block to determine if the `interval` seconds have passed since the `lastTimeStamp`. 
When `checkTask` returns `true`, the Automation  calls `performTask()` on-chain and increments the counter. This cycle repeats until the Task is cancelled or runs out of funding.

Compile and deploy your own Automation Counter onto a supported Testnet (currently, BNB Smart Chain).

1. In the Remix example, select the **Compile** tab on the left and press the compile button. Make sure that your contract compiles without any errors. Note that the Warning messages in this example are acceptable and will not block the deployment.
2. Select the **Deploy** tab, set the **environment** to **Injected Provider â€” MetaMask**, confirm connecting to MetaMask, and deploy the AutomatedCounter.sol smart contract to Binance Smart Chain Testnet. When deploying the contract, specify the interval value; use a short value, e.g., 3s. This is the interval at which the `performTask()` function will be called.
   1. After deployment is complete, copy the address of the deployed contract. This address is required to register your Task.

We will now look at each function in a compatible contract in detail.

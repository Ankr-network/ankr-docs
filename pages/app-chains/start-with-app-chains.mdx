# AppChains step-by-step

If you're new to AppChains and don't yet know what setup to choose, the [AppChain Configurator](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/configurator/) will help you decide and will connect you with our experts. 

Once you have an idea about the setup, this is what the process of customizing, launching, and testing your AppChain will look like.

## Step 1
First, you need to launch a testnet so you can experiment, test, and determine which features and customizations you really want to include in the final product.

Start with validator nodes, which are essentially the basis of any Proof-of-Stake blockchain network. 
Five to seven validators is a good amount to start with.

You’ll also need an RPC endpoint to interact with your network. 
The RPC endpoint is how devs can request data from and interact with your AppChain testnet. 
Without an RPC endpoint, developers won’t be able to remotely connect with the AppChain. 

Once you have validator nodes and an RPC endpoint, you can start tooling with your testnet.

## Step 2
Once the testnet is live, spend some time testing different configurations and customizing it to your needs — which may be unique for use cases like, for example, Web3 gaming. 
Need help finding what works best? Ankr can help you learn about and test different configurations.

At this point, a faucet that dispenses testnet tokens and a block explorer will be extremely helpful. 
These tools will enable you to test different functionalities ahead of a mainnet release, and keep a close eye on your AppChain testnet data in real time.

The staking UI should also be implemented alongside the block explorer. 
A staking interface enables your users to help secure your network by staking to validator nodes. 
The staking interface will require wallet addresses to function, so it’s best to build these tools simultaneously.

## Step 3
Once the dust has settled, it’s time to launch the mainnet of your AppChain. 
This is a crucial step, and Ankr is here to help you ensure everything goes smoothly.

Once your AppChain is live on mainnet, and you gain some traction and transaction volume, you can participate in Ankr’s Exchange-Readiness program, which helps you prepare to present your native token to CEXs in order to potentially have it listed for trading.

Keep in mind that as part of Ankr’s AppChain program, you’ll have hands-on engineering support throughout this whole process and for any and all issues that arise.

# Chainscanner

Chainscanner is a first-of-its-kind blockchain data hub and is the face of [Ankr AppChains](https://www.ankr.com/app-chains/), our end-to-end infrastructure solution which creates tailored and application-specific blockchains. 

Featuring a user-friendly web UI, Chainscanner provides critical insights for users to learn about different chains and decentralized applications — combining CoinMarketCap-like research tools with Etherscan-like functionality.

The core functionality includes:
1. Block explorer — transparently displays all on-chain data.
2. Staking interface — allows users to earn staking rewards with their favorite tokens.
3. Validator enrollment hub — provides onboarding to contribute validator nodes.
4. Governance portal — lets users vote on app updates and the direction of ecosystems.
5. Development resource — offers devs testnet tokens, docs, and resources for building.
6. Information source — provides unique insight into the hosted chains and apps.

Chainscanner makes all this available to all users, regardless if they have an AppChain or any technical background.

Now users can participate beyond the application level to truly benefit from the unique aspects of Web3 — such as co-ownership, shared rewards, and democratized decision-making.

## Why Build Chainscanner?
Just as highways and bridges are the physical infrastructures that allow us to drive, digital infrastructure is what powers the internet applications we use daily. 
Digital infrastructure (specifically blockchain infrastructure) consists of complex lines of code that power dApps. 
However, we can share the important insights that blockchain infrastructure provides without showing the actual code and programming languages that built it.

Chainscanner provides a simple and understandable user interface over the blockchain infrastructure that powers our AppChain projects. 
The hubs’s purpose is for developers to view the core infrastructure of a blockchain and for dApp users to analyze the application’s critical data points and visualize the actions available to them. 
Interacting with this new feature allows users to become truly knowledgeable and involved with their favorite applications. 
Chainscanner provides the educational experience for Web2 users to get comfortable utilizing Web3 dApps. 
And further, the experience will empower those users to go beyond positions as speculative investors and become experienced token/coin holders.

## Use cases now on Chainscanner
The below applications are the first to integrate with AppChain Infrastructure.
Soon, the Chainscanner hub will host various Web3 use cases on Ankr AppChains, supporting decentralized music, social media, news and insurance applications, and CBDCs. 
Anyone using Chainscanner can interact with all these dApps to view top stats, earn rewards, vote on app updates (if an owner), and easily see any info related to the chain.

### Gaming — Meta Apes
[Meta Apes](https://metaapesgame.com/) is a viral Web3 game based on the original "Age of Apes" mobile strategy game and is now one of the most downloaded mobile games in Asia.

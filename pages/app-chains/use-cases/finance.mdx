## Introduction
These use case has been developed specifically for finance projects looking to launch Web3 services using Ankr AppChains. 
The information contained here is not intended to provide strict rules, but rather loose guidelines to help developers think about where to start constructing their ideal AppChain.

## Problem
Finance has long been contrained by the limitation of Web2. Banking and financial services in their classical form are often unable to trickle down to developing part of the world such as Africa, part of South Asia, Latin America.
Unfamiliar with their benefits, people in these countries have a inherent mistrust of banks, which makes their adoption even harder.
Meanwhile, new and exciting DeFi opportunities are often percieved as bringing more freedom and independence from financial institutions. They appear as exciting opportunities to many who want to enter and profit from finance.

An extreme case can be made with people in distant African regions, who run a local banking system among themselves, where every unit or member of their community contributes to the "bank" — a person in charge of the collective fund.
This fund then can benefit a unit, which is a family, by the decision of the community, and give an opportunity otherwise unreachable — to buy appliance or machinery needed for local production, or even to build a house.
The same pattern can be seen in Asia, where members of the family put their saving together to buy a lodging for the oldest. In some time, another round takes place providing a lodging for the next oldest person and so on.

All these cases have a distinct pattern — people are keeping their savings at hand, in cash, because they mistrust classical financial institutions.

Blockchain, specifically DeFi that has been rapidly growing in popularity last 2 years, presents a perfect opportunity. It's times easier, both legally, time-wise and marketing-wise, to create an online service on a technology perceived as freeing and hence desired, than it is to establish a bank and persuade people to come to it.

## Solution 
Blockchain, specifically a modular set. A modular blockchain offers greater customization.

AppChains are a perfect case for that. It's an ecosystem of modules that tailed specifically to your needs into your own AppChain instance.

Ankr develops & launches your AppChain with your specific infrastructure needs including such modules as: 
* _Validator nodes_ — the core of any PoS blockchain, they process transactions and add new blocks to the chain. 
* _Full nodes_ — enable developers to communicate with (and build on) your AppChain using RPCs.
* _RPC endpoints_ — track and analyze transactions, addresses, and blocks on your AppChain.
* _Block explorers_ — a complete visual set of accounts and their history.
* _Testnets & faucets_ — free testnet tokens for developers to test what they're building on your AppChain.
* _Staking mechanisms_ — staking functionality and a UI interface to enable users to stake native tokens to your AppChain through a simple, elegant interface.
* _Wallet integrations_ — wider adoption among users of different crypto wallets where they store funds.
* _Bridging solutions_ — bring tokens from other network to your AppChain or bring your native tokens to other platforms.
* _On-ramp solutions_ — enable easy transfers between fiat and crypto and back for the users.

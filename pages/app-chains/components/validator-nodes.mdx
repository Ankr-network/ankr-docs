# Validator nodes

The core of any Proof-of-Stake blockchain are validator nodes — they process transactions and add new blocks to the chain.  
So before you can even get your testnet off the ground, you'll need validator nodes to support it.

## Pick a base chain
These nodes need to both validate your AppChain, and sync up with your chosen parent chain. 
This means they’ll need to be specially configured to integrate with either BNB Chain, Avalanche, or Polygon.

## Launch your validator nodes
**Option 1 (experienced Web3 developers)**

Ankr supplies the validator binary and configuration files that correspond to your chosen parent chain. With these instructions and docs, you can set up your own validator nodes.

**Option 2 (new to Web3, or want SLA support)**

Ankr provides full engineering support to a set of validator nodes for your AppChain. This includes maintenance, updates, and hosting services for one year. After a year, you can renew your service, or take over the reins.

# Staking UI interface
Enable users to stake your token to your App Chain through a simple, elegant UI interface.

## What is Ankr’s staking UI interface?
Ankr offers a dedicated pathway for your token holders to stake their assets with validators on your App Chain with an easy-to-use interface.

## Why does my App Chain need a staking UI?
Like any Proof-of-Stake blockchain, App Chains need validators to stake native tokens in order to participate in securing the network and adding new blocks. 
With a simple staking interface, it’s easy for your token holders to delegate their stake to validators of your App Chain network.

The more assets are staked, the more secure your App Chain becomes, and the more attractive it is to CEXs that are interested in potentially listing your token for trading.

## How does staking UI work?
Ankr either provides integration with our existing staking platform, or our engineers can build a custom staking platform from scratch for your App Chain, depending on your needs.

**Option 1**

Ankr offers integration with the Ankr Staking platform so that App Chain users can easily stake tokens from the App Chain using our smart contract.

**Option 2**

Ankr creates a new delegated staking platform so that App Chain users can easily stake tokens through a dedicated interface.
Choose from three different locations for the staking UI:
1. On your App Chain website.
2. On a shared website for App Chain staking built by Ankr.
3. Have staking built into your App Chain’s dedicated block explorer.

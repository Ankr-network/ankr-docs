# Validator enrollment hub
Validator enrollment hub is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.

It allows users to become validators. 
Validators power a blockchain, validating transactions, creating new blocks and including those transactions in them.  

Validators can gain a commission from users staking with them and also gain from validating transactions and creating new blocks.
Validators can also create new governance proposals to change the rules of an AppChain; such proposals can be voted for or against.

2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Tesnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.

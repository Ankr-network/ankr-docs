# Cross-chain bridge

Cross-chain bridge is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.
AppChain's bridge solution is powered by [BridgeHub](http://bridgehub.app/).

The bridge is a single gateway to all AppChains. It allows users to quickly transfer their assets between different AppChains.

You can bridge assets on:
* Testnet, as a developer who's setting up and testing out their AppChain.
* Mainnet, as a user or a developer who needs to bridge assets in or out of an AppChain.

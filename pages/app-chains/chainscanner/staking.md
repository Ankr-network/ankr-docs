# Staking
Staking is a base infrastructure component of Ankr AppChains implemented in Chainscanner.

As more and more crypto users are getting used to gaining yield on their crypto assets with DeFi in last years, staking is becoming a widespread and demanded service on blockchain.

Staking on AppChains has been created to help users make better use of their crypto assets as well their capable hardware:
* It eases up user interaction, allowing anybody to stake with various validators available on an AppChain. 
* Capable hardware owners can also register to become a validator on an AppChain and make profit from transaction validation, block creation, and users staking with their validator node.

## Use staking

### Validators on AppChain
#### Register a validator
Validators can gain a commission from users staking with them and also gain from validating transactions and creating new blocks.
Validators can create new governance proposals to change the rules of an AppChain; such proposals can be voted for or against.

To become a validator, you need to register as one:
1. Visit the [Staking dashboard](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/staking/?network=bas-mapes&section=dashboard&validators=active) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Tesnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/select-network-in-block-explorer.jpg" alt="Select a network" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
3. On the dashboard, click **Register New Validator**. 
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/click-register-new-validator.jpg" alt="Click Register New Validator" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
4. Read the terms and click **Start registration** if agreed.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/read-terms-and-click-start.jpg" alt="Click Start registration" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
5. Provide your address, set a commission rate and initial stake for you validator, and click **Register**.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/register-as-validator.jpg" alt="Set validator parameters and click Register" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
6. Confirm filing your registration.

Now let the network decide on your registration form.

#### Check pending validators
After registering to be a validator, you need to wait until the network decides on it.

To check pending validators:
1. Visit the [Staking dashboard](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/staking/?network=bas-mapes&section=dashboard&validators=active) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Tesnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/select-network-in-block-explorer.jpg" alt="Select a network" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
3. On the dashboard, click **Pending Validators**. 
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/click-pending-validators.jpg" alt="Click Pending Validators" class="responsive-pic" width="900" />

#### Check jailed validators
Underperforming or malicious validators can get jailed for some time. 
If you suspect your validator has been jailed, you can check it.

To check jailed validators:
1. Visit the [Staking dashboard](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/staking/?network=bas-mapes&section=dashboard&validators=active) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Tesnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.

### Governance on AppChain
#### Create a proposal
AppChains can be flexible and allow validators to change their governance model. 
The model is changed via proposals that live a certain timeline to be voted for or against. 
Once a proposal has enough votes in its timeline, it's either executed or defeated accordingly.
Proposals that live past their timeline get stale and discarded; nobody can vote on a stale proposal.

Only validators can create new proposals. 

To create a new governance proposal:
1. Visit the [Staking dashboard](https://chainscanner.xyz/ankr/appchains/staking/?network=bas-mapes&section=dashboard&validators=active) (preselected meta-apes network).
2. Select a network to access. The selection popup shows you Mainnet networks.<br /> To see available Tesnet networks, click on **Access Testnets**.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/select-network-in-block-explorer.jpg" alt="Select a network" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />
3. On the dashboard, click **Governance**. 
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/click-governance.jpg" alt="Click Governance" class="responsive-pic" width="900" />
4. Click **Create Proposal**.
   <img src="/docs/app-chains/infrastructure-within-chainscanner/click-create-new-proposal.jpg" alt="Click Create Proposal" class="responsive-pic" width="900" />
5. Set the terms of proposal and proceed to submitting it.

Now you can wait till the proposal is adopted or rejected, that is, executed or defeated.

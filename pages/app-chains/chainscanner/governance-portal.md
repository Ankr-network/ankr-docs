# Governance portal
AppChains can be flexible and allow validators to change their governance model. 
The model is changed via proposals that live a certain timeline to be voted for or against. 
Once a proposal has enough votes in its timeline, it's either executed or defeated accordingly.
Proposals that live past their timeline get stale and discarded; nobody can vote on a stale proposal.

## Use governance portal

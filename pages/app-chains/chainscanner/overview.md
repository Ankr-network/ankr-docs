# Chainscanner

Chainscanner is the user interface for [Ankr AppChains](https://www.ankr.com/app-chains/).
It’s an all-in-one platform for application-specific blockchains that provides a central hub where Ankr AppChain developers and users alike can view important data and interact with their desired AppChains.
On Chainscanner, anyone can search for on-chain info like transaction data and dApps history, stake their tokens, vote on governance proposals, access development resources, and learn more about how specific AppChains work.

It combines CoinMarketCap-like research tools with Etherscan-like functionality.

The core functionality of Chainscanner includes:
1. Block explorer — transparently displays all on-chain data.
2. Staking interface — allows users to earn staking rewards with their favorite tokens.
3. Bridging interface — a third-party solution to bridge tokens between AppChains, powered by BirdgeHub.
4. Validator enrollment hub — provides onboarding to contribute validator nodes.
5. Governance portal — lets users vote on app updates and the direction of ecosystems.
6. Development resource — offers devs testnet tokens, docs, and resources for building.
7. Information source — provides unique insight into the hosted chains and apps.

Chainscanner makes all this available to all users, regardless if they have an AppChain or any technical background.

Now users can participate beyond the application level to truly benefit from the unique aspects of Web3 — such as co-ownership, shared rewards, and democratized decision-making.

## Why Build Chainscanner?
Just as highways and bridges are the physical infrastructures that allow us to drive, digital infrastructure is what powers the internet applications we use daily.
Digital infrastructure (specifically blockchain infrastructure) consists of complex lines of code that power dApps.
However, we can share the important insights that blockchain infrastructure provides without showing the actual code and programming languages that built it.

Chainscanner provides a simple and understandable user interface over the blockchain infrastructure that powers our AppChain projects.
The hub's purpose is for developers to view the core infrastructure of a blockchain and for dApp users to analyze the application’s critical data points and visualize the actions available to them.
Interacting with this new feature allows users to become truly knowledgeable and involved with their favorite applications.
Chainscanner provides the educational experience for Web2 users to get comfortable utilizing Web3 dApps.
And further, the experience will empower those users to go beyond positions as speculative investors and become experienced token/coin holders.

## Use cases now on Chainscanner
The below applications are the first to integrate with AppChain Infrastructure.
Soon, the Chainscanner hub will host various Web3 use cases on Ankr AppChains, supporting decentralized music, social media, news and insurance applications, and CBDCs.
Anyone using Chainscanner can interact with all these dApps to view top stats, earn rewards, vote on app updates (if an owner), and easily see any info related to the chain.

# Pricing

> Premium plan's blockchain requests measure in *API Credits*.

For both our Premium plan's charging models — [Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)](/rpc-service/service-plans/#pay-as-you-go) and [Deal](/rpc-service/service-plans/#deal) — we charge per method used in request. Various methods have different API credit values per request. A method's API credit value calculates based on a method's usage intensity and multiple factors that include using the computational, memory, storage, and network resources.

**The price of our API Credits is pegged to USD**. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the latest _ANKR/USD_ exchange rate.

> **0.10 USD = 1M API Credits**

# Pricing

Premium Plan's chain requests measure in *API Credits*. Our Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model charges per method used in request. Various methods have different credit values per request. A method's credit value calculates based on a method's usage intensity and multiple factors that include using the computational, memory, storage, and network resources.

**The price of our API Credits is pegged to USD**. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the latest _ANKR/USD_ exchange rate.

> **Our PAYG pricing model:**  
> **0.10 USD = 1M API Credits**

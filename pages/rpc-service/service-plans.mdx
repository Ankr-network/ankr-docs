# Service plans

Ankr provides the top-performing globally-distributed enterprise-grade infrastructure of nodes to empower your Web3 projects with blockchain interaction capabilities.

Our solutions work under the following Service Plans:

  * **Public** — public endpoints for free blockchain interaction provided with Public [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
  * **Premium** — private endpoints for high-performing blockchain interaction provided with Premium [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
    * **Freemium** — this is not a service plan per se, but can be perceived as a transition state between Public and Premium services. You have to sign in on the platform without topping up your account balance to access Premium [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) but under Public [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
  * **Enterprise** — customer-tailored solutions for the most demanding blockchain interaction cases.

Here is the list of solutions we have at your disposal on the [Web3 API](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform under the Service Plan you've selected:

  * *[Node API](/rpc-service/overview/)* — the endpoints that enable your Web3 projects to start interacting with an extensive list of [supported blockchains](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/), give access to viewing the usage statistics for the data queried, and provide the means for RPC API methods testing.

  * *[Advanced API](/advanced-api/overview)* — a ready-to-use indexed collection of endpoints that supports simultaneous querying of multiple blockchains (15 mainnet and 4 testnet chains available) for the most popular Web3 scenarios at near-instant speeds; available via [JavaScript](/advanced-api/javascript-sdk)/[Python](/advanced-api/python-sdk) SDKs and [React Hooks](/advanced-api/react-hooks). Advanced API also gives you access to the usage statistics for the data queried.

Here is the list of blockchains supported: [Chains Quickstart](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/).

## Service plans comparison

<Callout type="tip">
 Advanced API is available for an [authenticated user](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in) only.
</Callout>

The `Node API` and `Advanced API` solutions come with both *Public* and *Premium* service plans but differ significantly by the rate limits and other performance features supported depending on the plan selected.

## Charging models

Our Premium service plan users can choose to query blockchain data under the following charging models:

  * [Pay-as-you-go](/rpc-service/service-plans/#pay-as-you-go) — pay for each request you make.
  * [Deal](/rpc-service/service-plans/#deal) — monthly subscription for 6 Billion API credits at 20% discount.

### Pay-as-you-go

*Pay-as-you-go* (PAYG) is a usage-based charging model for the Premium Plan services. PAYG means that you commit to no subscriptions but pay for each request you make. The minimum PAYG deposit to start using the Premium Plan features is `10USD` (or equivalent amount in ANKR tokens).

### Deal

<Callout type="warning">
We discontinue the `500USD` *Package* subscription to introduce a more cost-efficient *Deal* option.
</Callout>

*Deal* is a subscription-based charging model for the Premium Plan services. It is a recurring `500USD` payment at a `20% discount` that provides you with `6 Billion` API credits that you can spend within a month to call both *Node* and *Advanced APIs* for all the chains we support.

**Deal in a nutshell**:

  * `6 Billion` monthly API credits at a `20% discount`.
  * Both *Node and Advanced APIs* included.
  * *All chains* covered.

**Package-to-Deal transition**:

  * The transition from the *Package* to *Deal* subscription performs automatically upon the next subscription renewal.
  * Before the renewal, the *Package* users continue to operate under their current subscription (30M calls, Node API, EVM-compatible protocols).
  * Starting from the first subscription renewal, there is no more *Package* — let's have a *Deal*!

## PAYG pricing

**The price of our API Credits is pegged to USD**. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the latest _ANKR/USD_ exchange rate.

> **Our PAYG pricing model:**
> **0.10 USD = 1M API Credits**

### How we charge?

For both our Premium plan's charging models — [Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)](/rpc-service/service-plans/#pay-as-you-go) and [Deal](/rpc-service/service-plans/#deal) — we charge per method used in request. Various methods have different API credit values per request. A method's API credit value calculates based on a method's usage intensity and multiple factors that include using the computational, memory, storage, and network resources.

We charge no matter whether a request has been successful or not. In other words, a charge is taken for each request coming to our worker, regardless of a node's response.

**PAYG/Deal charging summary**:

> `Correct call` — `Incorrect call` — `Correct call + incorrect method`

  * **Correct call** (charged) — a request uses a supported method and has a valid JSON-RPC structure.
  * **Incorrect call** (not charged) — a request has an invalid JSON-RPC structure or a batch request has the same ID in multiple requests. We can't parse such a request.
  * **Correct call + incorrect method** (charged default amount) — a request uses an unsupported method though has a valid JSON-RPC structure. We charge default amount of credits for the infrastructure usage.

# Service plans

Ankr provides the top-performing globally-distributed decentralized infrastructure of nodes to empower your Web3 projects with blockchain interaction capabilities.

Our solutions work under the following Service Plans:

  * **Public** — public endpoints for free blockchain interaction provided with Public [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
  * **Premium** — private endpoints for high-performing blockchain interaction provided with Premium [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
  * **Enterprise** — customer-tailored solutions for the most demanding blockchain interaction cases.

Here is the list of solutions we have at your disposal on the [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform under the Service Plan you've selected:

  * *[RPC/REST API](/rpc-service/overview/)* — the endpoints that enable your Web3 projects to start interacting with an extensive list of [supported blockchains](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/), give access to viewing the usage statistics for the data queried, and provide the means for RPC API methods testing.

  * *[Advanced API](/advanced-api/overview)* — a ready-to-use indexed collection of endpoints that supports simultaneous querying of multiple blockchains (9 currently available) for the most popular Web3 scenarios at near-instant speeds; available via [JavaScript](/advanced-api/javascript-sdk)/[Python](/advanced-api/python-sdk) SDKs and [React Hooks](/advanced-api/react-hooks). Advanced API also gives you access to the usage statistics for the data queried.

Here is the list of blockchains supported: [Chains Quickstart](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/).

## Service plans comparison

<Callout type="tip">
 Advanced API is available for an [authenticated user](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in) only.
</Callout>

The `RPC/REST API` and `Advanced API` solutions come with both *Public* and *Premium* service plans but differ significantly by the rate limits and other performance features supported depending on the plan selected.

## Charging models

Our Premium service plan users can choose to query blockchains under the following charging models:

  * [Pay-as-you-go](/rpc-service/service-plans/#pay-as-you-go) — pay for each request you make.
  * [Subscription](/rpc-service/service-plans/#subscription) — pay for one-month service bundle.

### Pay-as-you-go

_Pay-as-you-go_ (PAYG) is a usage-based charging model for the Premium Plan services. PAYG means that you commit to no subscriptions but pay for each request you make. To start using the Premium Plan features, you deposit a minimum amount of 1000 ANKR tokens and create an Ankr Premium account.

[//]: # (## Get started with Premium)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. Go to the [RPC Services]&#40;https://www.ankr.com/rpc/&#41; platform.)

[//]: # (2. [Connect your wallet]&#40;/rpc-service/premium-account-operations/#connect-wallet&#41;.)

[//]: # (3. [Deposit funds]&#40;/rpc-service/premium-account-operations/#top-up&#41;.)

[//]: # (4. [Add Premium Endpoints into your project]&#40;/rpc-service/blockchain-interactions/#rpc-apis-for-your-project&#41; to interact with a blockchain.)

### Subscription

*Subscription* is a charging model under which you pay a fixed price for a particular bundle of services on a monthly basis. Our current `500 USD` subscription offers the following service bundle:

  * `30M` requests per month
  * `10` whitelist domains
  * `10` whitelist IP addresses
  * EVM-compatible methods for all chains (except for Solana and Advanced API)
  * Team management

## Pricing

**The price of our API Credits is pegged to USD**. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the latest _ANKR/USD_ exchange rate.

> **Our PAYG pricing model:**
> **0.10 USD = 1M API Credits**

### How we charge?

Premium Plan's chain requests measure in *API Credits*. PAYG model charges per method used in request. Various methods have different credit values per request. A method's credit value calculates based on a method's usage intensity and multiple factors that include using the computational, memory, storage, and network resources.

We charge no matter whether a request has been successful or not. In other words, a charge is taken for each request coming to our worker, regardless of a node's response.

PAYG charging summary:

> `Correct call` — `Incorrect call` — `Currect call + incorrect method`

  * **Correct call** (charged) — a request uses a supported method and has a valid JSON-RPC structure.
  * **Incorrect call** (not charged) — a request has an invalid JSON-RPC structure or a batch request has the same ID in multiple requests. We can't parse such a request.
  * **Correct call + incorrect method** (charged default amount) — a request uses an unsupported method though has a valid JSON-RPC structure. We charge default amount of credits for the infrastructure usage.

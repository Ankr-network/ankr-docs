# Service plans

Ankr provides the top-performing globally-distributed decentralized infrastructure of nodes to empower your Web3 projects with blockchain interaction capabilities.

There is a couple of solutions we have at your disposal on the [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform:

  * *[RPC API](/rpc-service/overview/)* — the endpoints that enable your Web3 projects to start interacting with an extensive list of [supported blockchains](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/), give access to viewing the usage statistics for the data queried, and provide the means for RPC API methods testing.

  * *[Advanced API](/advanced-api/overview)* — a ready-to-use indexed collection of endpoints that supports simultaneous querying of multiple blockchains (9 currently available) for the most popular Web3 scenarios at near-instant speeds; available via [JavaScript](/advanced-api/javascript-sdk)/[Python](/advanced-api/python-sdk) SDKs and [React Hooks](/advanced-api/react-hooks). Advanced API also gives you access to the usage statistics for the data queried.

To find info on the blockchains supported, see [Chains Quickstart](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/).

## Service plans comparison

<Callout type="tip">
 Advanced API is available for an [authenticated user](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in) only.
</Callout>

The `RPC API` and `Advanced API` solutions come with both *Public* and *Premium* service plans but differ significantly by the rate limits and other performance features supported depending on the plan selected.

## Charging model: Pay-as-you-go

_Pay-as-you-go_ (PAYG) is a usage-based charging model for the Premium Plan services. PAYG means that you commit to no subscriptions but pay for each request you make. To start using the Premium Plan features, you deposit a minimum amount of 1000 ANKR tokens and create an Ankr Premium account.

### How we charge?

Premium Plan's RPC usage measures in *API Credits*. PAYG model charges per method used in request. Various methods have different credit values per request. A method's credit value calculates based on a method's usage intensity and multiple factors that include using the computational, memory, storage, and network resources.

[//]: # (Premium Plan supports two communication protocols:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (* **HTTPS** — this one is used either for individual or batch requests.)

[//]: # (* **WebSocket** — this one is used to establish a communication channel.)

We charge no matter whether a request has been successful or not. In other words, a charge is taken for each request coming to our worker, regardless of a node's response.

Here is the summary on PAYG charging:

  * **Correct request** (charged) — a request uses a supported method and has a valid JSON-RPC structure. 
  * **Incorrect request** (not charged) — a request has an invalid JSON-RPC structure or a batch request has the same ID in multiple requests. We can't parse such a request.
  * **Correct request + incorrect method** (charged default amount) — a request uses an unsupported method though has a valid JSON-RPC structure. We charge default amount of credits for the infrastructure usage.

## Pricing

**The price of our API Credits is pegged to USD**. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the latest _ANKR/USD_ exchange rate.

> **Our PAYG pricing model:**
> **0.10 USD = 1M API Credits**

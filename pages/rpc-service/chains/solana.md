# Solana

**Solana** is an open source project implementing a high-performance, permissionless blockchain.

The Solana architecture combines a set of software algorithms to remove software as a performance bottlenecks and allow transaction throughput to scale proportionally with network bandwidth. As a result, the Solana blockchain is **scalable**, **secure** and **decentralized**.

## Connect wallet

**Solana** is not evm-compatible and therefore MetaMask cannot currently be configured to work with Solana.

Solana does support several types of wallets via usage of the the [Solana native command-line app](https://docs.solana.com/cli) as well as wallets from third-parties.

For developers, [command-line wallets](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) are recommended as new features on the Solana blockchain are supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party solutions.

## Integrate CLI

Solana uses it's own command-line tools to interact with a Solana cluster.

Solana provides easy to follow guidance in their [documentation on how to install and use Solana Command Line (CLI) tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli).

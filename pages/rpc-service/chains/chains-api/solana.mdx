# Solana
<br/>

<img src="/docs/build/chains-list/solana.png" class="responsive-pic" width="800" />

> Solana API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/solana).

*Solana* is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with the Arbitrum blockchain — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a Solana node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in many various message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## `getAccountInfo`

> **Returns all information associated with the account of provided Pubkey.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>`: pubkey of account to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object): limit the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<null>`: if the requested account doesn't exist.
  * `<object>`: otherwise a JSON object containing:
    * `lamports` (u64): number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data` ([string, encoding]|object): data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on the encoding parameter.
    * `executable` (boolean): boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

    * `<u64>`: slot, as a u64 integer.
    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following optional fields:
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `transactionDetails` (string): level of transaction detail to return, either "full", "accounts", "signatures", or "none". If parameter not provided, the default detail level is "full". If "accounts" are requested, transaction details only include signatures and an annotated list of accounts in each transaction. Transaction metadata is limited to only: fee, err, pre_balances, post_balances, pre_token_balances, and post_token_balances.
      * `rewards` (boolean): whether to populate the `rewards` array. If parameter not provided, the default includes rewards.
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
      * `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` (number): sets the max transaction version to return in responses. If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error will be returned. If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and a block containing any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

## `getBlockHeight`

> **Returns the current block height of the node.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<u64>`: a current block height.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana/{your_token} \

## `getEpochInfo`

> **Returns information about the current epoch.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result field will be an object with the following fields:

  * `absoluteSlot` (u64): the current slot.
  * `blockHeight` (u64): the current block height.
  * `epoch` (u64): the current epoch.
  * `slotIndex` (u64): the current slot relative to the start of the current epoch.
  * `slotsInEpoch` (u64): the number of slots in this epoch.
  * `transactionCount` (u64|null) total number of transactions processed without error since genesis.

## `getLatestBlockhash`

<Callout type="tip">
NEW: This method is only available in solana-core v1.9 or newer. Please use [`getRecentBlockhash`](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/solana/#getrecentblockhash) for solana-core v1.8
</Callout>

> **Returns the latest blockhash.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string; optional): used for retrieving blockhash); the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number; optional): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<object>`: a JSON object with value field set to a JSON object including:
  * `blockhash` (string): a hash as base-58 encoded string.
  * `lastValidBlockHeight` (u64): the last block height at which the blockhash will be valid.

### Request example

    * `<array>`: an array of Pubkeys to query, as base-58 encoded strings (up to a maximum of 100).
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object): limits the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result will be a JSON object with value equal to an array of:

  * `null`: if the account at that Pubkey doesn't exist.
  * `<object>`: otherwise, a JSON object containing:
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): a base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data`([string, encoding]|object): data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on the encoding parameter.
    * `executable`(boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

## `getSignaturesForAddress`

> **Returns signatures for confirmed transactions that include the given address in their `accountKeys` list.**

Returns signatures backwards in time from the provided signature or most recent confirmed block.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the account address as a base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `limit` (number): the maximum transaction signatures to return (between 1 and 1,000, default: 1,000).
      * `before` (string): starts searching backwards from this transaction signature. If not provided the search starts from the top of the highest max confirmed block.
      * `until` (string): searches until this transaction signature, if found before limit reached.
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The `result` field is an array of transaction signature information, ordered from newest to oldest transaction:

  * `signature` (string): the transaction signature as base-58 encoded string.
  * `slot` (u64): the slot that contains the block with the transaction.
  * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError definitions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13).
  * `memo` (string|null): the memo associated with the transaction, null if there is no memo.
  * `blockTime` (i64|null): estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) of when transaction was processed. null if not available.
  * `confirmationStatus` (string|null): the transaction's cluster confirmation status; either processed, confirmed, or finalized.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `null`: an unknown transaction.
  * `<object>`: a known transaction; contains the following parameters:
    * `slot` (u64): the slot the transaction was processed at.
    * `confirmations` (usize|null): the number of blocks since signature confirmation, null if rooted, as well as finalized by a supermajority of the cluster.
    * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError definitions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13).

        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `epoch` (u64): the epoch for which to calculate activation details. If parameter not provided, defaults to the current epoch.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The `result` object contains the following fields:

  * `state` (string): the stake account's activation state, one of: `active`, `inactive`, `activating`, `deactivating`.
  * `active` (u64): the stake active during the epoch.
  * `inactive` (u64): the stake inactive during the epoch.

## `getTokenAccountsByDelegate`

> **Returns all SPL Token accounts by approved Delegate.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the pubkey of account delegate to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (required): either:
      * `mint` (string): the pubkey of the specific token Mint to limit accounts to, as base-58 encoded string; or
      * `programId` (string): the pubkey of the Token program that owns the accounts, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object; optional): limits the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number; optional): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `pubkey` (string): the account Pubkey as base-58 encoded string.
  * `account` (object): a JSON object, with the following subfields:
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): the base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data` (object): the Token state data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or in JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`.
    * `executable` (boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

## `getTokenLargestAccounts`

> **Returns the 20 largest accounts of a particular SPL Token type.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the Pubkey of token Mint to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following field:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `address` (string): the address of the token account.
  * `amount` (string): the raw token account balance without decimals, a string representation of u64.
  * `decimals` (u8): the number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
  * `uiAmount` (number|null): the token account balance, using mint-prescribed decimals [DEPRECATED].
  * `uiAmountString` (string): the token account balance as a string, using mint-prescribed decimals.

## `getTransaction`

> **Returns transaction details for a confirmed transaction.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the transaction signature as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following optional fields:
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
      * `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` (number): sets the max transaction version to return in responses. If the requested transaction is a higher version, an error will be returned. If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `null`: if transaction is not found or not confirmed.
  * `<object>`: if transaction is confirmed, an object with the following fields:
    * `slot` (u64): the slot this transaction was processed in.
    * `transaction` (object|[string,encoding]): a [transaction](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#transaction-structure) object, either in JSON format or encoded binary data, depending on encoding parameter.
    * `blockTime` (i64|null): the estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) of when the transaction was processed. null if not available.
    * `meta` (object|null): the transaction status metadata object:
      * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError](https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.14.11/solana_sdk/transaction/enum.TransactionError.html) definitions.

## `getTransactionCount`

> **Returns the current Transaction count from the ledger.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * commitment (string; optional): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<u64>`: the count.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana/{your_token} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "getTransactionCount"
    }'
```

### Response example

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": 133855482658,
    "id": 1
}
```

## `getVoteAccounts`

> **Returns the account info and associated stake for all the voting accounts in the current bank.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `votePubkey` (string): only returns the results for this validator vote address (base-58 encoded).
      * `keepUnstakedDelinquents` (boolean): set to `true` to not filter out delinquent validators with no stake.
      * `delinquentSlotDistance` (u64): specify the number of slots behind the tip that a validator must fall to be considered delinquent. NOTE: For the sake of consistency between ecosystem products, it is not recommended that this argument be specified.

### Returns

The result field will be a JSON object of `current` and `delinquent` accounts, each containing an array of JSON objects with the following subfields:

  * `votePubkey` (string): the vote account address, as base-58 encoded string.
  * `nodePubkey` (string): the validator identity, as base-58 encoded string.
  * `activatedStake` (u64): the stake, in lamports, delegated to this vote account and active in this epoch.
  * `epochVoteAccount` (boolean): `true` if the vote account is staked for this epoch, otherwise `false`.
  * `commission` (number): the percentage (0-100) of rewards payout owed to the vote account.
  * `lastVote` (u64): the most recent slot voted on by this vote account.
  * `epochCredits` (array): the history of how many credits earned by the end of each epoch, as an array of arrays containing: `[epoch, credits, previousCredits]`.

## `sendTransaction`

> **Submits a signed transaction to the cluster for processing.**

This method does not alter the transaction in any way; it relays the transaction created by clients to the node as-is.

If the node's rpc service receives the transaction, this method immediately succeeds, without waiting for any confirmations. A successful response from this method does not guarantee the transaction is processed or confirmed by the cluster.

While the rpc service will reasonably retry to submit it, the transaction could be rejected if transaction's `recent_blockhash` expires before it lands.

Use [`getSignatureStatuses`](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/solana/#getsignaturestatuses) to ensure a transaction is processed and confirmed.

Before submitting, the following preflight checks are performed:

  1. The transaction signatures are verified.
  2. The transaction is simulated against the bank slot specified by the preflight commitment. On failure an error will be returned. Preflight checks may be disabled if desired. It is recommended to specify the same commitment and preflight commitment to avoid confusing behavior.

The returned signature is the first signature in the transaction, which is used to identify the transaction ([transaction id](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#transaction-id)). This identifier can be easily extracted from the transaction data before submission.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): a fully-signed Transaction, as encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `skipPreflight` (boolean): if `true`, skip the preflight transaction checks (default: `false`).
      * `preflightCommitment` (string; default: "finalized"): a commitment level to use for preflight. The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string; default: "base58"): the encoding used for the transaction data. Either "base58" (slow, DEPRECATED), or "base64".
      * `maxRetries` (usize): the maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the leader. If this parameter not provided, the RPC node will retry the transaction until it is finalized or until the blockhash expires.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot at which to perform preflight transaction checks.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<string>`: the first Transaction Signature embedded in the transaction, as base-58 encoded string ([transaction id](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#transaction-id)).

### Request example

## `simulateTransaction`

> **Simulates sending a transaction.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the transaction, as an encoded string. The transaction must have a valid blockhash, but is not required to be signed.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `sigVerify` (boolean): if `true` the transaction signatures will be verified (default: `false`, conflicts with `replaceRecentBlockhash`).
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): a commitment level to simulate the transaction at. The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string; default: "base58"): the encoding used for the transaction data. Either "base58" (slow, DEPRECATED), or "base64".
      * `replaceRecentBlockhash` (boolean): if `true` the transaction recent blockhash will be replaced with the most recent blockhash. (default: `false`, conflicts with `sigVerify`).
      * `accounts` (object): the accounts configuration object containing the following fields:
        * `encoding` (string): encoding for returned Account data, either "base64" (default), "base64+zstd" or "jsonParsed". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to binary encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `<string>`.
        * `addresses` (array): an array of accounts to return, as base-58 encoded strings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result will be a JSON object with the `value` containing the following fields:

  * `err` (object|string|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13) definitions.
  * `logs` (array|null): an array of log messages the transaction instructions output during execution, null if simulation failed before the transaction was able to execute (for example due to an invalid blockhash or signature verification failure).
  * `accounts` (array|null): an array of accounts with the same length as the `accounts.addresses` array in the request:
    * `<null>`: if the account doesn't exist or if `err` is not null.
    * `<object>`: otherwise, a JSON object containing:
      * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
      * `owner` (string): the base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
      * `data` ([string, encoding]|object): the data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on encoding parameter.
      * `executable` (boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
      * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.
    * `unitsConsumed` (u64|undefined): the number of compute budget units consumed during the processing of this transaction.
    * `returnData` (object|null): the most-recent return data generated by an instruction in the transaction, with the following fields:
      * `programId` (string): the program that generated the return data, as base-58 encoded Pubkey.
      * `data` ([string, encoding]): the return data itself, as base-64 encoded binary data.

## `getConfirmedBlock` (DEPRECATED)

<Callout type="warning">
DEPRECATED: Please use [`getBlock`](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/solana/#getblock) instead. This method is expected to be removed in solana-core v2.0
</Callout>

> **Returns identity and transaction information about a confirmed block in the ledger.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<u64>` (required): the slot, as u64 integer.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `encoding` (string): the encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `transactionDetails` (string): the level of transaction detail to return, either "full", "signatures", or "none". If parameter not provided, the default detail level is "full".
      * `rewards` (boolean): whether to populate the rewards array. If parameter not provided, the default includes rewards.
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.

### Returns

The `result` is an object containing the following fields:

  * `null`: if specified block is not confirmed.
  * `<object>`: if block is confirmed, an object with the following fields:
    * `blockhash` (string):  the blockhash of this block, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `previousBlockhash` (string): the blockhash of this block's parent, as base-58 encoded string; if the parent block is not available due to ledger cleanup, this field will return "11111111111111111111111111111111".
    * `parentSlot` (u64): the slot index of this block's parent.
    * `transactions` (array): to be included if "full" transaction details are requested; an array of JSON objects containing:
      * `transaction` (object|[string,encoding]): the [Transaction](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#transaction-structure) object, either in JSON format or encoded binary data, depending on encoding parameter.
      * `meta` (object): the transaction status metadata object, containing null or:
        * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13) definitions.
        * `fee` (u64): the fee this transaction was charged, as u64 integer.
        * `preBalances` (array): an array of u64 account balances from before the transaction was processed.
        * `postBalances` (array): an array of u64 account balances after the transaction was processed.
        * `innerInstructions` (array|null): the list of [inner instructions](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#inner-instructions-structure) or null if inner instruction recording was not enabled during this transaction.
        * `preTokenBalances` (array|undefined): the list of [token balances](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#token-balances-structure) from before the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction.
        * `postTokenBalances` (array|undefined): the list of [token balances](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#token-balances-structure) from after the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction.
        * `logMessages` (array|null): an array of string log messages or null if log message recording was not enabled during this transaction.
        * [DEPRECATED] `status` (object): the transaction status.
          * `"Ok": <null>`: the transaction was successful.
          * `"Err": <ERR>`: the Transaction failed with TransactionError.
    * `signatures` (array): to be included if "signatures" are requested for transaction details; an array of signatures strings, corresponding to the transaction order in the block.
    * `rewards` (array): to be included if rewards are requested; an array of JSON objects containing:
      * `pubkey` (string): the public key, as base-58 encoded string, of the account that received the reward.
      * `lamports` (i64): the number of reward lamports credited or debited by the account, as a i64.
      * `postBalance` (u64): the account balance in lamports after the reward was applied.
      * `rewardType` (string|undefined): the type of reward: "fee", "rent", "voting", "staking".
      * `commission` (u8|undefined): the vote account commission when the reward was credited, only present for voting and staking rewards.
    * `blockTime` (i64|null): the estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch). null if not available.

## `getConfirmedTransaction` (DEPRECATED)

<Callout type="warning">
DEPRECATED: Please use [`getTransaction`](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/solana/#gettransaction) instead. This method is expected to be removed in solana-core v2.0
</Callout>

> **Returns transaction details for a confirmed transaction.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the transaction signature as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following optional fields:
      * `encoding` (string): the encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `null`: if the transaction is not found or not confirmed.
  * `<object>`: if the transaction is confirmed, an object with the following fields:
    * `slot` (u64): the slot this transaction was processed in.
    * `transaction` (object|[string,encoding]): the [Transaction](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#transaction-structure) object, either in JSON format or encoded binary data, depending on encoding parameter.
    * `blockTime` (i64|null): the estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) of when the transaction was processed; null if not available.
    * `meta` (object|null): the transaction status metadata object:
      * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError](https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/1.14.11/solana_sdk/transaction/enum.TransactionError.html) definitions.
      * `fee` (u64): the fee this transaction was charged, as u64 integer.
      * `preBalances` (array): an array of u64 account balances from before the transaction was processed.
      * `postBalances` (array): an array of u64 account balances after the transaction was processed.
      * `innerInstructions` (array|null): the list of [inner instructions](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#inner-instructions-structure) or `null` if inner instruction recording was not enabled during this transaction.
      * `preTokenBalances` (array|undefined): the list of [token balances](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#token-balances-structure) from before the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction.
      * `postTokenBalances` (array|undefined): the list of [token balances](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#token-balances-structure) from after the transaction was processed or omitted if token balance recording was not yet enabled during this transaction.
      * `logMessages` (array|null): an array of string log messages or `null` if log message recording was not enabled during this transaction.
      * [DEPRECATED] `status` (object): the Transaction status.
        * `"Ok": <null>`: the Transaction was successful.
        * `"Err": <ERR>`: the Transaction failed with TransactionError.

          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `blockhash` (string): the Hash as base-58 encoded string.
  * `feeCalculator` (object): the FeeCalculator object, the fee schedule for this block hash.

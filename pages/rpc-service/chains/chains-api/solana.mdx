# Solana
<br/>

<img src="/docs/build/chains-list/solana.png" class="responsive-pic" width="800" />

> Solana API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/solana).

*Solana* is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with the Arbitrum blockchain — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a Solana node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in many various message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## `getAccountInfo`

> **Returns all information associated with the account of provided Pubkey.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>`: pubkey of account to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object): limit the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<null>`: if the requested account doesn't exist.
  * `<object>`: otherwise a JSON object containing:
    * `lamports` (u64): number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data` ([string, encoding]|object): data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on the encoding parameter.
    * `executable` (boolean): boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<u64>`: slot, as a u64 integer.
    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following optional fields:
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `transactionDetails` (string): level of transaction detail to return, either "full", "accounts", "signatures", or "none". If parameter not provided, the default detail level is "full". If "accounts" are requested, transaction details only include signatures and an annotated list of accounts in each transaction. Transaction metadata is limited to only: fee, err, pre_balances, post_balances, pre_token_balances, and post_token_balances.
      * `rewards` (boolean): whether to populate the `rewards` array. If parameter not provided, the default includes rewards.
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
      * `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` (number): sets the max transaction version to return in responses. If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error will be returned. If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and a block containing any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

## `getBlockHeight`

> **Returns the current block height of the node.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<u64>`: a current block height.

### Request example

```shell

          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `range` (object): a slot range to return block production for. If parameter not provided, defaults to current epoch:
        * `firstSlot` (u64): the first slot to return block production information for (inclusive).
        * `lastSlot` (u64): the last slot to return block production information for (inclusive). If parameter not provided, defaults to the highest slot.

## `getEpochInfo`

> **Returns information about the current epoch.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result field will be an object with the following fields:

  * `absoluteSlot` (u64): the current slot.
  * `blockHeight` (u64): the current block height.
  * `epoch` (u64): the current epoch.
  * `slotIndex` (u64): the current slot relative to the start of the current epoch.
  * `slotsInEpoch` (u64): the number of slots in this epoch.
  * `transactionCount` (u64|null) total number of transactions processed without error since genesis.

When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `filter` (string; optional): filters results by account type; currently supported: `circulating`|`nonCirculating`.

### Returns

The result will be a JSON object with value equal to an array of:

  * `<object>`: a JSON object containing the following fields:
    * `address` (string): the base-58 encoded address of the account.
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports in the account, as a u64.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<array>`: an array of Pubkeys to query, as base-58 encoded strings (up to a maximum of 100).
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object): limits the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result will be a JSON object with value equal to an array of:

  * `null`: if the account at that Pubkey doesn't exist.
  * `<object>`: otherwise, a JSON object containing:
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): a base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data`([string, encoding]|object): data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on the encoding parameter.
    * `executable`(boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object): limits the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `filters` (array): filters the results using up to 4 filter objects; the account must meet all the filter criteria to be included in results:
        * `memcmp` (object): compares a provided series of bytes with program account data at a particular offset. Fields:
          * `offset` (usize): an offset into program account data to start comparison.
          * `bytes` (string): the data to match, as encoded string.
          * `encoding` (string): an encoding for the filter bytes data, either "base58" or "base64". Data is limited in size to 128 or fewer decoded bytes. NEW: This field, and base64 support generally, is only available in solana-core v1.14.0 or newer. Please omit when querying nodes on earlier versions.
        * `dataSize` (u64): compares the program account data length with the provided data size
      * `withContext` (boolean): wraps the result in a JSON object.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

By default, the result field will be an array of JSON objects. If `withContext` flag is set, the array will be wrapped in a JSON object.

  * `pubkey` (string): the account Pubkey as base-58 encoded string.
  * `account` (object): a JSON object, with the following subfields:
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): the base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data` ([string,encoding]|object): the data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on encoding parameter.
    * `executable` (bool): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as a u64.

## `getSignaturesForAddress`

> **Returns signatures for confirmed transactions that include the given address in their `accountKeys` list.**

Returns signatures backwards in time from the provided signature or most recent confirmed block.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the account address as a base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `limit` (number): the maximum transaction signatures to return (between 1 and 1,000, default: 1,000).
      * `before` (string): starts searching backwards from this transaction signature. If not provided the search starts from the top of the highest max confirmed block.
      * `until` (string): searches until this transaction signature, if found before limit reached.
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The `result` field is an array of transaction signature information, ordered from newest to oldest transaction:

  * `signature` (string): the transaction signature as base-58 encoded string.
  * `slot` (u64): the slot that contains the block with the transaction.
  * `err` (object|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError definitions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13).
  * `memo` (string|null): the memo associated with the transaction, null if there is no memo.
  * `blockTime` (i64|null): estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) of when transaction was processed. null if not available.
  * `confirmationStatus` (string|null): the transaction's cluster confirmation status; either processed, confirmed, or finalized.

## `getTokenAccountBalance`

> **Returns the token balance of an SPL Token account.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the pubkey of Token account to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following field:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `amount` (string): the raw balance without decimals, a string representation of u64.
  * `decimals` (u8): the number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
  * `uiAmount` (number|null): the balance, using mint-prescribed decimals [DEPRECATED].
  * `uiAmountString` (string): the balance as a string, using mint-prescribed decimals.

### Request example

## `getTokenAccountsByDelegate`

> **Returns all SPL Token accounts by approved Delegate.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the pubkey of account delegate to query, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (required): either:
      * `mint` (string): the pubkey of the specific token Mint to limit accounts to, as base-58 encoded string; or
      * `programId` (string): the pubkey of the Token program that owns the accounts, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for Account data, either "base58" (slow), "base64", "base64+zstd", or "jsonParsed". "base58" is limited to Account data of less than 129 bytes. "base64" will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size. "base64+zstd" compresses the Account data using [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result. ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to "base64" encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.
      * `dataSlice` (object; optional): limits the returned account data using the provided `offset: <usize>` and `length: <usize>` fields; only available for "base58", "base64" or "base64+zstd" encodings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number; optional): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `pubkey` (string): the account Pubkey as base-58 encoded string.
  * `account` (object): a JSON object, with the following subfields:
    * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
    * `owner` (string): the base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
    * `data` (object): the Token state data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or in JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`.
    * `executable` (boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
    * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.

        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

### Returns

The result contains the `value` object with the following fields:

  * `address` (string): the address of the token account.
  * `amount` (string): the raw token account balance without decimals, a string representation of u64.
  * `decimals` (u8): the number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
  * `uiAmount` (number|null): the token account balance, using mint-prescribed decimals [DEPRECATED].
  * `uiAmountString` (string): the token account balance as a string, using mint-prescribed decimals.

## `getTransaction`

> **Returns transaction details for a confirmed transaction.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the transaction signature as base-58 encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following optional fields:
      * `encoding` (string): encoding for each returned Transaction, either "json", "jsonParsed", "base58" (slow), "base64". If parameter not provided, the default encoding is "json". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return more human-readable and explicit data in the `transaction.message.instructions` list. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex` fields).
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
      * `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` (number): sets the max transaction version to return in responses. If the requested transaction is a higher version, an error will be returned. If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

## `getTransactionCount`

> **Returns the current Transaction count from the ledger.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * commitment (string; optional): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<u64>`: the count.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet/{your_token} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "getTransactionCount"
    }'
```

### Response example

    "result": 15541529698
}
```

---

## `getVersion`

> **Returns the current solana versions running on the node.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required): None.

### Returns

The `result` object contains the following parameters:

  * `solana-core`: the software version of solana-core.
  * `feature-set`: a unique identifier of the current software's feature set.

### Request parameters

{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "feature-set": 3294202862,
        "solana-core": "2.2.3"
    }
}
```

---

## `getVoteAccounts`

> **Returns the account info and associated stake for all the voting accounts in the current bank.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `commitment` (string): the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time.

      * `keepUnstakedDelinquents` (boolean): set to `true` to not filter out delinquent validators with no stake.
      * `delinquentSlotDistance` (u64): specify the number of slots behind the tip that a validator must fall to be considered delinquent. NOTE: For the sake of consistency between ecosystem products, it is not recommended that this argument be specified.

### Returns

The result field will be a JSON object of `current` and `delinquent` accounts, each containing an array of JSON objects with the following subfields:

  * `votePubkey` (string): the vote account address, as base-58 encoded string.
  * `nodePubkey` (string): the validator identity, as base-58 encoded string.
  * `activatedStake` (u64): the stake, in lamports, delegated to this vote account and active in this epoch.
  * `epochVoteAccount` (boolean): `true` if the vote account is staked for this epoch, otherwise `false`.
  * `commission` (number): the percentage (0-100) of rewards payout owed to the vote account.
  * `lastVote` (u64): the most recent slot voted on by this vote account.

## `minimumLedgerSlot`

> **Returns the lowest slot that the node has information about in its ledger.**

This value may increase over time if the node is configured to purge older ledger data.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required): None.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<u64>`: the minimum ledger slot.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet/{your_token} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
     "id":45,
     "jsonrpc":"2.0",
     "method":"minimumLedgerSlot"
   }'
```

### Response example

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": 370994242,
    "id": 45
}
```

## `requestAirdrop`

> **Requests an airdrop of lamports to a Pubkey.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the Pubkey of the account to receive lamports, as base-58 encoded string.
    * `integer` (required): lamports, as a u64.
    * `object` (optional): the configuration object containing the following field:
      * `commitment` (string): used for retrieving blockhash and verifying airdrop success; the commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<string>`: the Transaction Signature of airdrop, as base-58 encoded string.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet/{your_token} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

          1000000000
      ]
   }'
```

### Response example

## `sendTransaction`

> **Submits a signed transaction to the cluster for processing.**

This method does not alter the transaction in any way; it relays the transaction created by clients to the node as-is.

If the node's rpc service receives the transaction, this method immediately succeeds, without waiting for any confirmations. A successful response from this method does not guarantee the transaction is processed or confirmed by the cluster.

While the rpc service will reasonably retry to submit it, the transaction could be rejected if transaction's `recent_blockhash` expires before it lands.

Use [`getSignatureStatuses`](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/solana/#getsignaturestatuses) to ensure a transaction is processed and confirmed.

Before submitting, the following preflight checks are performed:

  1. The transaction signatures are verified.
  2. The transaction is simulated against the bank slot specified by the preflight commitment. On failure an error will be returned. Preflight checks may be disabled if desired. It is recommended to specify the same commitment and preflight commitment to avoid confusing behavior.

The returned signature is the first signature in the transaction, which is used to identify the transaction ([transaction id](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#transaction-id)). This identifier can be easily extracted from the transaction data before submission.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): a fully-signed Transaction, as encoded string.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `skipPreflight` (boolean): if `true`, skip the preflight transaction checks (default: `false`).
      * `preflightCommitment` (string; default: "finalized"): a commitment level to use for preflight. The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string; default: "base58"): the encoding used for the transaction data. Either "base58" (slow, DEPRECATED), or "base64".
      * `maxRetries` (usize): the maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the leader. If this parameter not provided, the RPC node will retry the transaction until it is finalized or until the blockhash expires.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot at which to perform preflight transaction checks.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `<string>`: the first Transaction Signature embedded in the transaction, as base-58 encoded string ([transaction id](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#transaction-id)).

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet/{your_token} \

## `simulateTransaction`

> **Simulates sending a transaction.**

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0). 
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<string>` (required): the transaction, as an encoded string. The transaction must have a valid blockhash, but is not required to be signed.
    * `<object>` (optional): the configuration object containing the following fields:
      * `sigVerify` (boolean): if `true` the transaction signatures will be verified (default: `false`, conflicts with `replaceRecentBlockhash`).
      * `commitment` (string; default: "finalized"): a commitment level to simulate the transaction at. The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back. For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use "confirmed" commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use "finalized" commitment:
        * `finalized`: the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        * `confirmed`: the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
          * it incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
          * it does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
          * this confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.
        * `processed`: the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.
      * `encoding` (string; default: "base58"): the encoding used for the transaction data. Either "base58" (slow, DEPRECATED), or "base64".
      * `replaceRecentBlockhash` (boolean): if `true` the transaction recent blockhash will be replaced with the most recent blockhash. (default: `false`, conflicts with `sigVerify`).
      * `accounts` (object): the accounts configuration object containing the following fields:
        * `encoding` (string): encoding for returned Account data, either "base64" (default), "base64+zstd" or "jsonParsed". ["jsonParsed" encoding](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#parsed-responses) attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable and explicit account state data. If "jsonParsed" is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls back to binary encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `<string>`.
        * `addresses` (array): an array of accounts to return, as base-58 encoded strings.
      * `minContextSlot` (number): sets the minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### Returns

The result will be a JSON object with the `value` containing the following fields:

  * `err` (object|string|null): Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See the [TransactionError](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13) definitions.
  * `logs` (array|null): an array of log messages the transaction instructions output during execution, null if simulation failed before the transaction was able to execute (for example due to an invalid blockhash or signature verification failure).
  * `accounts` (array|null): an array of accounts with the same length as the `accounts.addresses` array in the request:
    * `<null>`: if the account doesn't exist or if `err` is not null.
    * `<object>`: otherwise, a JSON object containing:
      * `lamports` (u64): the number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64.
      * `owner` (string): the base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.
      * `data` ([string, encoding]|object): the data associated with the account, either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`, depending on encoding parameter.
      * `executable` (boolean): a boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only).
      * `rentEpoch` (u64): the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64.
    * `unitsConsumed` (u64|undefined): the number of compute budget units consumed during the processing of this transaction.
    * `returnData` (object|null): the most-recent return data generated by an instruction in the transaction, with the following fields:
      * `programId` (string): the program that generated the return data, as base-58 encoded Pubkey.
      * `data` ([string, encoding]): the return data itself, as base-64 encoded binary data.

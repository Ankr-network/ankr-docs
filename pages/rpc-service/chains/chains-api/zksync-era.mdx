# zkSync Era

> zkSync Era API is available on [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/zksync_era).

zkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring or re-auditing a single line of code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers write smart contracts in C++, Rust, and other popular languages.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with zkSync Era — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a zkSync Era node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## `eth_sendRawTransaction`

> Creates new message call transaction or a contract creation for signed transactions.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<string>` (data): the signed transaction data.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (data, 32 bytes): the transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

Use [eth_getTransactionReceipt](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/zksync-era/#eth_gettransactionreceipt) to get the contract address, after the transaction was mined, when you created a contract.

## `eth_call`

> Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<object>` (hex encoded): the transaction object:
        * `from` (string; data, 20 bytes; optional): the address the transaction is sent from.
        * `to` (string; data, 20 bytes): the address the transaction is directed to.
        * `gas` (string; quantity; optional): the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_call` consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
        * `gasPrice` (string; quantity; optional): the gas price willing to be paid by the sender in wei.
        * `value` (string; quantity; optional): the value sent with this transaction, in wei.
        * `data` (string; data; optional): the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.
        * `latest`: the most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client; this block can be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (hex encoded bytes): the return value of executed contract.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/zksync_era \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## `eth_estimateGas`

> Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete.

The transaction will not be added to the blockchain. Note that the estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance.

### Parameters

        * `value` (string; quantity; optional): the value sent with this transaction, in wei; note that if the value exceeds the `from` address balance (which is 0.000000000000000001 ETH by default), then you'll receive an `insufficient funds` error in response.
        * `data` (string; data; optional): the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag; optional): either a HEX value of a *block number* or one of the following *block tags*:

## `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`

> Returns information on a transaction by block number and transaction index position.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.

## `eth_getLogs`

> Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

      1. `object`: the filter options:

         * `fromBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `toBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
         * `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
         * `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

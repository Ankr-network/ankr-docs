# Syscoin

> Syscoin API is available on [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/syscoin).

Syscoin is a Proof-of-Work blockchain solution merge-mined with Bitcoin. At its base is a dual-chain Layer 1: the core is the Syscoin native blockchain, and running in tandem with it is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain called NEVM (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine), which provides modularity, enhanced security, and full byte-for-byte Ethereum compatibility.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with Syscoin — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a Syscoin node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

### Parameters
<br/>

## `eth_getLogs`

> Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

  1. `object`: the filter options:

* `fromBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either a hex of the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

  * `latest`: for the last mined block.
  * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
  * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

* `toBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

  * `latest`: for the last mined block.
  * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
  * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

* `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
* `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
* `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

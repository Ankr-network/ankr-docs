# Monad

> Monad API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/monad).

*Monad* is an Ethereum-compatible Layer-1 blockchain with 10,000 tps of throughput, 500ms block frequency, and 1s finality.

Monad's implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine complies with the Cancun fork; simulation of historical Ethereum transactions with the Monad execution environment produces identical outcomes. Monad also offers full Ethereum RPC compatibility so that users can interact with Monad using familiar tools like Etherscan, Phantom, or MetaMask.

Monad accomplishes these performance improvements, while preserving backward compatibility, through the introduction of several major innovations:

  * [MonadBFT](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/monad-bft) for performant, tail-fork-resistant BFT consensus.
  * [RaptorCast](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/raptorcast) for efficient block transmission.
  * [Asynchronous Execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/asynchronous-execution) for pipelining consensus and execution to raise the time budget for execution.
  * [Parallel Execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/parallel-execution) for efficient transaction execution.
  * [MonadDb](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/monaddb) for efficient state access.

Although Monad features parallel execution and pipelining, it's important to note that blocks in Monad are linear, and transactions are linearly ordered within each block.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with Monad — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a Monad node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

Responses come in [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## `eth_call`

> Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<object>` (hex encoded): the transaction object:
        * `from` (string; data, 20 bytes; optional): the address the transaction is sent from.
        * `to` (string; data, 20 bytes): the address the transaction is directed to.
        * `gas` (string; quantity; optional): the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_call` consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
        * `gasPrice` (string; quantity; optional): the gas price willing to be paid by the sender in wei.
        * `value` (string; quantity; optional): the value sent with this transaction, in wei.
        * `data` (string; data; optional): the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.
        * `latest`: the most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client; this block can be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (hex encoded bytes): the return value of executed contract.

### Request example

## `eth_estimateGas`

> Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete.

The transaction will not be added to the blockchain. Note that the estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance.

### Parameters

  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (quantity): the amount of gas used.

## `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`

> Returns information on a transaction by block number and transaction index position.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.
        * `latest`: the most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client; this block can be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

## `eth_getLogs`

> Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

      1. `object`: the filter options:

         * `fromBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `toBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
         * `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
         * `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

# B2 Network

> B² Network API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/b2).

The B² Network is an advanced Layer-2 solution designed to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and broaden application diversity without compromising security. It is notable for being the first zero-knowledge proof verification commitment rollup on Bitcoin.

Key Features:

  * **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Utilizes zero-knowledge proof technology to ensure transactional privacy and security, allowing for the verification of transactions without revealing the underlying data.

  * **Rollup Technology**: Processes multiple off-chain transactions and rolls them into a single on-chain transaction, significantly increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

  * **Turing-Complete Smart Contracts**: Supports Turing-complete smart contracts, enabling complex computations and a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) to run off-chain with enhanced performance.

  *  **Gate Commitment and Challenge-Response Mechanism**: Integrates gate commitment and challenge-response mechanisms, leveraging Taproot on Bitcoin to ensure secure and private transaction confirmations.

  * **EVM-Compatibility**: The B² Network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing it to run Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps. This compatibility enables developers to use existing Ethereum tools, libraries, and standards while benefiting from the B² Network's enhanced features.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with B² Network — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a B² Network node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

    1. `<string>` (data, 20 bytes): an address to get the code from.
    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.

        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

## `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex`

> Returns information about an uncle of a block by number and uncle index position.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.
        * `latest`: the most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client; this block can be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.
    2. `<string>` (quantity): the uncle's  index position.

## `eth_getLogs`

> Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

      1. `object`: the filter options:

         * `fromBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `toBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
         * `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
         * `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

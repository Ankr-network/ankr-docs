# OKX X1

> OKX X1 API is available on [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/okx_x1/).

X1 is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 network that offers a secure and user-friendly blockchain experience to all users, using advanced cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to provide validity and near-instant finality to off-chain transaction computations.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with OKX X1 — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a OKX X1 node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

## `eth_sendRawTransaction`

> Creates new message call transaction or a contract creation for signed transactions.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<string>` (data): the signed transaction data.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (data, 32 bytes): the transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

Use [eth_getTransactionReceipt](/rpc-service/chains/chains-api/okx_x1/#eth_gettransactionreceipt) to get the contract address, after the transaction was mined, when you created a contract.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/okx_x1_testnet \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_sendRawTransaction",

## `eth_call`

> Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    1. `<object>` (hex encoded): the transaction object:
        * `from` (string; data, 20 bytes; optional): the address the transaction is sent from.
        * `to` (string; data, 20 bytes): the address the transaction is directed to.
        * `gas` (string; quantity; optional): the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_call` consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
        * `gasPrice` (string; quantity; optional): the gas price willing to be paid by the sender in wei.
        * `value` (string; quantity; optional): the value sent with this transaction, in wei.
        * `data` (string; data; optional): the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters.

    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.
        * `latest`: the most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client; this block can be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

### Returns

  * `<string>` (hex encoded bytes): the return value of executed contract.

### Request example

```shell
curl -X POST https://rpc.ankr.com/okx_x1_testnet \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## `eth_estimateGas`

## `eth_getLogs`

> Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

      1. `object`: the filter options:

         * `fromBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `toBlock` (string; quantity|tag; optional; default: "latest"): either the _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:

             * `latest`: for the last mined block.
             * `earliest`: for the lowest numbered block available on the client.
             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
         * `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
         * `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

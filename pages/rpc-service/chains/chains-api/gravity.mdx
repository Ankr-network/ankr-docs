# Gravity

> Gravity API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/gravity).

*Gravity* is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for mass adoption and an omnichain future. Gravity features the following key points:

  * **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Gravity enables developers to define and settle transactions across multiple blockchains, enhancing efficiency and security.
  * **Efficient Verification**: With cost-efficient ZKP verification, Gravity ensures economical and secure transactions.
  * **Enhanced User Experience**: Gravity introduces cryptographic primitives like the secp256r1 curve through precompiled contracts, allowing for cost-effective passkey authentication for Account Abstraction wallets.
  * **High-Performance Execution**: Gravity integrates the Reth execution layer and the Jolteon consensus algorithm, providing high throughput and near-instant finality.
  * **Secure and Robust PoS Mechanism**: Powered by G token staking and restaking protocols like Babylon and EigenLayer, Gravity's PoS design incentivizes and unites a diverse community to secure the chain.
  * **EVM-Compatible**: Gravity is fully EVM-compatible, enabling seamless deployment and interaction with smart contracts.

In order for your Web3 application to interact with Gravity — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to a Gravity node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

    1. `<string>` (data, 20 bytes): an address to get the code from.
    2. `<string>` (quantity|tag): either the hex value of a _block number_ or one of the following _block tags_:
        * `earliest`: the lowest numbered block available on the client.
        * `finalized`: the most recent crypto-economically secure block; cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination.
        * `safe`: the most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions.

        * `pending`: a sample next block built by the client on top of the `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. In other words, it is the block that has not been mined yet.

             * `pending`: for not yet mined transactions.

         * `address` (array of strings; data, 20 bytes; optional): a contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
         * `topics` (array of strings; data; optional): an array of 32 bytes data topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of data with "or" options.
         * `blockhash` (string; data, 32 bytes; optional; **future**): with the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to `fromBlock = toBlock = the block` number with hash blockHash. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns
<br/>

  * `removed` (string; tag): `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it's a valid log.
  * `logIndex` (string; quantity): the log index position in the block; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionIndex` (string; quantity): the transactions index position log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `transactionHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the transactions this log was created from; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockHash` (string; data, 32 bytes): a hash of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `blockNumber` (string; quantity): the number of the block containing the log; null when it's pending; null when it's a pending log.
  * `address` (string; data, 20 bytes): an address from which this log originated.
  * `data` (string; data): contains one or more 32 bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics` (array of strings; data): an array of 0 to 4 32 bytes data of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)

## `debug_traceBlockByHash`

> Traces the execution of all transactions within a block specified by hash.

### Parameters
<br/>

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `<blockHash>` (string; required): the hash of the block you want to trace.
    * `tracer` (string; optional): the tracer to use for the operation. Tracers can customize the output, for example, by including only certain types of operations. Common tracers are the following:
      * `callTracer`: generates a detailed trace of all calls, including internal contract calls. `callTracer` has the following parameters:
        * `onlyTopCall` (boolean): if `true`, only the top-level call is traced.
        * `tracerConfig` (object): additional options to customize the output, such as including or excluding specific call types.
      * `prestateTracer`: traces the state of accounts before the execution of transactions.
      * `noopTracer`: a no-operation tracer that returns minimal information.
      * `fourByteTracer`: identifies the function signature of calls by analyzing the first four bytes of the calldata.
      * `memoryTracer`: traces memory changes during the execution of transactions. `memoryTracer` has the following parameters:
        * `disableMemory` (boolean): if true, memory output is omitted.
      * `opTracer`: traces all the EVM opcodes executed during a transaction. `opTracer` has the following parameters:
        * `includeMemory` (boolean): if true, includes memory output.
        * `includeStack` (boolean): if true, includes stack output.
        * `includeStorage` (boolean): if true, includes storage output.
      * `gasTracer`: traces the gas usage of the transaction and breaks it down by operation.
    * `timeout` (optional, string): sets a timeout for the tracing operation, expressed in milliseconds (e.g., "5s" for 5 seconds). If the operation exceeds this time, it will be terminated.
    * `tracingOptions` (optional, object): an object to specify additional options for the trace, such as:
      * `disableMemory` (boolean): if true, memory output is omitted.
      * `disableStack` (boolean): if true, stack output is omitted.
      * `disableStorage` (boolean): if true, storage output is omitted.

You can create custom tracers by combining existing tracer parameters or defining new ones. The flexibility of tracers allows you to tailor the debugging output to your specific needs, focusing on different aspects of transaction execution.

If you're working on specific use cases, it may be helpful to look into the Gravity blockchain documentation to get detailed information on additional or custom tracers that may be supported.

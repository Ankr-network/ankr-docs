# XRP

> XRP API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/xrp).



In order for your Web3 application to interact with XRP — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to an XRP node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## Methods supported

**Account Methods**:

An account in the XRP Ledger represents a holder of XRP and a sender of transactions. Use these methods to work with account info.

  * [`account_channels`]() — retrieves a list of payment channels where the account is the source of the channel.

**Account Methods**:

An account in the XRP Ledger represents a holder of XRP and a sender of transactions. Use these methods to work with account info.

## `account_channels`

> Retrieves a list of payment channels where the account is the source of the channel.

The `account_channels` method returns information about an account's Payment Channels. This includes only channels where the specified account is the channel's source, not the destination. (A channel's "source" and "owner" are the same.) All information retrieved is relative to a particular version of the ledger.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `account` (string — address???; required): look up channels where this account is the channel’s owner/source.
    * `destination_account` (string — address???; optional): a second account; if provided, filters results to payment channels whose destination is this account.
    * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): the unique hash of the ledger version to use (see Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `ledger_index` (number or string; optional): the ledger index of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically (see Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `limit` (number; optional): limits the number of transactions to retrieve. Must be between 10 and 400; values outside this range are adjusted to the nearest valid value. Default: 200.
    * `marker` (string — marker???; optional): value from a previous paginated response; resumes retrieving data where that response left off.

### Returns

The response follows the standard format???, with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `account` (string): the address of the source/owner of the payment channels. Corresponds to the `account` field of the request.
  * `channels` (array of objects): list of payment channels owned by this `account`. Each object contains the following fields:
    * `account` (string): the owner of the channel, as an address???.
    * `channel_id` (string): a unique ID for this channel, represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string. This is also the ???ID of the channel object??? in the ledger’s state data.
    * `destination_account` (string): the destination account of the channel, as an address. Only this account can receive the `amount` in the channel while it is open.
    * `settle_delay` (unsigned integer): the number of seconds the payment channel must remain open after the owner requests to close it.
    * `public_key` (string; optional): the public key for the payment channel in the XRP Ledger’s base58??? format. Signed claims against this channel must be redeemed with the matching key pair.
    * `public_key_hex` (string; optional): the public key for the payment channel in hexadecimal format, if one was specified at channel creation. Signed claims against this channel must be redeemed with the matching key pair.
    * `expiration` (unsigned integer; optional): time in ???seconds since the Ripple Epoch??? when this channel is set to expire. This expiration date is mutable. If this value is before the close time of the most recent validated ledger, the channel is expired.
    * `cancel_after` (unsigned integer; optional): time in ???seconds since the Ripple Epoch??? representing this channel’s immutable expiration, if one was specified at creation. If this is before the close time of the most recent validated ledger, the channel is expired.
    * `source_tag` (unsigned integer; optional): a 32-bit unsigned integer used as a ???source tag??? for payments through this payment channel, if specified at creation. This indicates the channel’s originator or purpose. Conventionally, if you bounce payments from this channel, you should include this value in the `DestinationTag` of the return payment.
    * `destination_tag` (unsigned integer; optional): a 32-bit unsigned integer used as a ???destination tag??? for payments through this payment channel, if specified at creation. This indicates the payment channel’s beneficiary or purpose at the destination account.
  * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): the identifying hash??? of the ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_index` (number): the ledger index??? of the ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `validated` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the information in this response comes from a validated ledger version; otherwise, the information is subject to change.

Describes the local rippled server’s queue state, which may differ across the network. Some fields may be omitted because certain values are computed lazily by the queuing mechanism. Contains the following nested fields:
    * `txn_count` (integer): number of queued transactions from this address.
    * `auth_change_queued` (boolean; optional): whether a transaction in the queue changes this address’s ???ways of authorizing transactions???. If `true`, no further transactions can be queued until that transaction executes or drops from the queue.
    * `lowest_sequence` (integer; optional): the lowest ???sequence number??? among transactions queued by this address.
    * `highest_sequence` (integer; optional): the highest ???sequence number??? among transactions queued by this address.
    * `max_spend_drops_total` (string; optional): the total number of ???drops of XRP??? that could be debited from this account if every queued transaction consumes the maximum possible amount.

  * `account` (string): the unique ???address??? of the account this request corresponds to — the perspective account for the listed trust lines.
  * `lines` (array of objects): array of trust line objects associated with the specified account. If the number of trust lines is large, only returns up to the limit at a time. Each object contains the following fields:

    * `account` (string — ???address???): the counterparty to this trust line.
    * `balance` (string — number???): the current balance held on this line.
      * A positive balance indicates that the perspective account holds value.
      * A negative balance indicates that the perspective account owes value.
    * `currency` (string — ???currency code???): the currency code of the token that this trust line represents.
    * `limit` (string — ???number???): the maximum amount of the given currency that this account is willing to owe the peer account.
    * `limit_peer` (string — number???): the maximum amount of the given currency that the counterparty is willing to owe the perspective account.
    * `quality_in` (number): rate at which the account values incoming balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. For example, a value of 500 million represents a `0.5:1` ratio. As a special case, 0 is treated as a `1:1` ratio.
    * `quality_out` (number): rate at which the account values outgoing balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. For example, a value of 500 million represents a `0.5:1` ratio. As a special case, 0 is treated as a `1:1` ratio.
    * `no_ripple` (boolean; optional): if `true`, this account has enabled the ???No Ripple flag??? for this trust line. If `false`, the flag is disabled, but this is not considered default??? when Default Ripple is also disabled. If omitted, No Ripple is disabled and Default Ripple is enabled.
    * `no_ripple_peer` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the peer account has enabled the ???No Ripple flag??? for this trust line. If `false`, the flag is disabled, but this is not considered ???default??? when Default Ripple is also disabled. If omitted, No Ripple is disabled and Default Ripple is enabled.
    * `authorized` (boolean; optional): if true, the perspective account ???has authorized this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `peer_authorized` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the counterparty ???has authorized this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `freeze` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the perspective account ???has frozen this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `freeze_peer` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the counterparty ???has frozen this trust line???. Default: `false`.

  * `ledger_current_index` (integer; optional): the ???ledger index??? used when retrieving this data. Present only when using an open ledger version.
  * `ledger_index` (integer; optional): the ???ledger index??? used when retrieving this data. Present only when using a closed ledger version.
  * `ledger_hash` (string — ???hash; optional): the identifying hash of the ledger version used when retrieving this data. This field is only provided when using a closed ledger version.
  * `marker` (string — marker???; optional): server-defined value indicating pagination; pass this to the next call to resume retrieving results from where this response ended. Omitted when there are no additional pages.
  * `limit` (number; optional): the maximum number of trust lines retrieved. The server may return fewer than the specified limit even if more results are available. Default: `200`.

## `account_objects`

> Retrieves all ledger objects owned by an account.

The `account_objects` command returns all ledger entries owned by an account, in their raw ???ledger format???.

There are other API methods that are specialized for getting certain types of ledger entry, such as the ???account_lines??? method for trust lines, or ???account_offers??? method for offers. These methods provide a processed view of the data that is more suitable for typical use cases. Use `account_objects` if you want to get ledger entries of types that don't have a specialized method, or if you want to get the entries in their canonical format.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `account` (string — ???address???; required): retrieves ledger entries associated with this account.
    * `deletion_blockers_only` (boolean; optional): if `true`, returns only ledger entries that would prevent this account from being deleted. Default: `false`.
    * `ledger_hash` (string — ???hash???; optional): the unique hash of the ledger version to use (see ???Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `ledger_index` (number or string; optional): the ???ledger index??? of the ledger version to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically (see ???Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `limit` (number; optional): the maximum number of ledger entries to include in the results. Must be between `10` and `400` for non-admin connections. Default: `200`.
    * `marker` (string — marker; optional): value from a previous paginated response; resumes retrieving data where that response left off.
    * `type` (string; optional): filters results by a specific type of ledger entry. Accepts canonical or ???short names?? of ???ledger entry types??? (case-insensitive). Ledger entry types that cannot appear in an owner directory are not allowed. If omitted, all types are returned.

### Returns

The response follows the ???standard format???, with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `account` (string — ???address???): the account this request corresponds to.
  * `account_objects` (array of objects): array of ledger entries found in this account’s owner directory. Includes both:
    * Entries owned directly by this account, and
    * Entries linked to this account but owned by others (for example, escrows where this account is the destination).
    * Each member is a ledger entry in its raw ???ledger format???. The number of entries may be fewer than the value specified in `limit`.
  * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): the identifying hash of the ledger used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_index` (number; optional): the ???ledger index??? of the ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_current_index` (number; optional): the ???ledger index??? of the open ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `limit` (number; optional): the limit value that was applied in this request, if specified.
  * `marker` (string — ???marker???; optional): server-defined value indicating pagination. Pass this to the next call to resume retrieving data where this response ended. Omitted when there are no additional pages.
  * `validated` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the data in this response originates from a validated ledger version; otherwise, it may be subject to change.

<Callout type="warning">
The `account_objects` array may be empty even if there are additional ledger entries to retrieve. This is especially likely when using `type` to filter ledger entry types. If the response includes a `marker` field, there are additional pages of data; if the response does not include a `marker`, then this is the end of the data. This behavior is a consequence of how the API method iterates through the account's owner directory, and a precaution against requests putting excessive load on the server.

## `account_tx`

> Retrieves a list of transactions affecting an account.

The `account_tx` method retrieves a list of validated transactions that involve a given account.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `account` (string; required): the unique identifier of the account, typically its address.
    * `tx_type` (string; optional): (Clio only) filters results to a specific transaction type (for example "Clawback", "AccountSet", "AccountDelete"). Case-insensitive. See ???Transaction Types???. ???New in: Clio v2.0???; ???AMM support since: Clio v2.1.0???.
    * `ledger_index_min` (integer; optional): earliest ledger index to include transactions from. A value of `-1` uses the earliest validated ledger available.
    * `ledger_index_max` (integer; optional): most recent ledger index to include transactions from. A value of `-1` uses the most recent validated ledger available.
    * `ledger_hash` (string — hash; optional): specifies a single ledger by its unique hash (see ???Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `ledger_index` (string or unsigned integer; optional): specifies a single ledger by its index or a shortcut keyword (see ???Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `binary` (boolean; optional): if `true`, returns transactions as hex strings instead of JSON. Default: `false`.
    * `forward` (boolean; optional): if `true`, returns results indexed with the oldest ledger first; otherwise, the newest ledger first. Each page may not be internally ordered, but pages overall follow the chosen order. Default: `false`.
    * `limit` (integer; optional): limits the number of transactions to retrieve. The default varies depending on server configuration. The server is not required to honor this value.
    * `marker` (string — ???marker???; optional): value from a previous paginated response; resumes retrieving data where that response left off. Stable even if the server’s available ledger range changes.

**Iterating over queried data**:

As with other paginated methods, you can use the `marker` field to return multiple pages of data.

In the time between requests, `"ledger_index_min": -1` and `"ledger_index_max": -1` may change to refer to different ledger versions than they did before. The `marker` field can safely paginate even if there are changes in the ledger range from the request, so long as the marker does not indicate a point outside the range of ledgers specified in the request.

### Returns

#### API v2

  * `account` (string): Unique ???Address??? identifying the related account.
  * `ledger_index_min` (integer — ???ledger index???): The ledger index of the earliest ledger actually searched for transactions.
  * `ledger_index_max` (integer — ???ledger index???): The ledger index of the most recent ledger actually searched for transactions.
  * `limit` (integer): The `limit` value used in the request. (This may differ from the actual limit value enforced by the server.)
  * `marker` (string — ???marker???): Server-defined value indicating the response is paginated. Pass this to the next call to resume where this call left off.
  * `transactions` (array): Array of transactions matching the request's criteria, as explained below.
  * `validated` (boolean): If included and set to `true`, the information in this response comes from a validated ledger version. Otherwise, the information is subject to change.

<Callout type="tip">
The server may respond with different values of `ledger_index_min` and `ledger_index_max` than you provided in the request, for example if it did not have the versions you specified on hand.
</Callout>

Each transaction object includes the following fields, depending on whether it was requested in JSON or hex string (`"binary": true`) format:

  * `ledger_hash` (string): A hex string of the ledger version that included this transaction.
  * `ledger_index` (integer): The ledger index of the ledger version that included this transaction.
  * `tx_json` (object — JSON): (JSON mode) JSON object defining the transaction.
  * `tx_blob` (string — binary): (Binary mode) A unique hex string defining the transaction.
  * `meta` (object — JSON): (JSON mode) The transaction results metadata in JSON.
  * `meta_blob` (string — binary): (Binary mode) The transaction results metadata as a hex string.

  * `transactions` (array): Array of transactions matching the request's criteria, as explained below.
  * `validated` (boolean): If included and set to `true`, the information in this response comes from a validated ledger version. Otherwise, the information is subject to change.

<Callout type="tip">
The server may respond with different values of `ledger_index_min` and `ledger_index_max` than you provided in the request, for example if it did not have the versions you specified on hand.
</Callout>

Each transaction object includes the following fields, depending on whether it was requested in JSON or hex string (`"binary": true`) format.

  * `ledger_index` (integer): The ledger index of the ledger version that included this transaction.
  * `tx` (object — JSON): (JSON mode) JSON object defining the transaction.
  * `tx_blob` (string — binary): (Binary mode) Hex string representing the transaction.
  * `meta` (object — JSON or string — binary): If `binary` is `true`, then this is a hex string of the transaction results metadata. Otherwise, the transaction results metadata is included in JSON format.
  * `validated` (boolean): Whether the transaction is included in a validated ledger or not. Any transaction not yet in a validated ledger is subject to change.

## `noripple_check`

> Gets recommended changes to an account's Default Ripple and No Ripple settings.

The `noripple_check` command provides a quick way to check the status of [the Default Ripple field for an account and the No Ripple flag of its trust lines](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling), compared with the recommended settings.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `account` (string): A unique identifier for the account, most commonly the account's address.
    * `role` (string): Whether the address refers to a `gateway` or `user`. Recommendations depend on the role of the account. Issuers must have Default Ripple enabled and must disable No Ripple on all trust lines. Users should have Default Ripple disabled, and should enable No Ripple on all trust lines.
    * `transactions` (boolean; optional): If `true`, include an array of suggested [transactions](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions), as JSON objects, that you can sign and submit to fix the problems. The default is `false`.
    * `limit` (unsigned integer; optional): The maximum number of trust line problems to include in the results. Defaults to 300.
    * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): The unique hash of the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers).)
    * `ledger_index` (string or unsigned integer; optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers).)

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `ledger_current_index` (number): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger used to calculate these results.
  * `problems` (array): Array of strings with human-readable descriptions of the problems. This includes up to one entry if the account's Default Ripple setting is not as recommended, plus up to `limit` entries for trust lines whose No Ripple setting is not as recommended.
  * `transactions` (array; optional): If the request specified `transactions` as `true`, this is an array of JSON objects, each of which is the JSON form of a [transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions) that should fix one of the described problems. The length of this array is the same as the `problems` array, and each entry is intended to fix the problem described at the same index into that array.

By default, members are the transactions’ identifying [Hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes) strings. If the request specified `expand` as `true`, members are full representations of the transactions instead, in either JSON or binary depending on whether the request specified `binary` as `true`.
  * `ledger_hash` (string): The unique identifying hash of the entire ledger, as hexadecimal.

  * `validated` (boolean; optional): If `true`, this is a validated ledger version. If omitted or set to `false`, this ledger’s data is not final.
  * `queue_data` (array; optional): (Omitted unless requested with the `queue` parameter) Array of objects describing queued transactions, in the same order as the queue. If the request specified `expand` as `true`, members contain full representations of the transactions, in either JSON or binary depending on whether the request specified `binary` as `true`.

Each member of the `queue_data` array represents one transaction in the queue. Some fields of this object may be omitted because they have not yet been calculated. The fields of this object are as follows:

  * `account` (string): The [Address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses) of the sender for this queued transaction.

If transactions are expanded in binary format, this is an object whose only field is `tx_blob`, containing the binary form of the transaction as a decimal string. If transactions are expanded in JSON format, this is an object containing the transaction object including the transaction's identifying hash in the `hash` field.
  * `retries_remaining` (number): How many times this transaction can be retried before being dropped.
  * `preflight_result` (string): The tentative result from preliminary transaction checking. This is always `tesSUCCESS`.
  * `last_result` (string; optional): If this transaction was left in the queue after getting a [retriable (`ter`) result](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results/ter-codes), this is the exact `ter` result code it got.
  * `auth_change` (boolean; optional): Whether this transaction changes this address's [ways of authorizing transactions](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions#authorizing-transactions).
  * `fee` (string; optional): The [Transaction Cost](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-cost) of this transaction, in [drops of XRP](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts).
  * `fee_level` (string; optional): The transaction cost of this transaction, relative to the minimum cost for this type of transaction, in fee levels.
  * `max_spend_drops` (string; optional): The maximum amount of [XRP, in drops](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts), this transaction could potentially send or destroy.

If the request specified `"owner_funds": true` and expanded transactions, the response has a field `owner_funds` in the `metaData` object of each [OfferCreate transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/offercreate). The purpose of this field is to make it easier to track the [funding status of offers](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/offers#lifecycle-of-an-offer) with each new validated ledger. This field is defined slightly differently than the version of this field in [Order Book subscription streams](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/subscription-methods/subscribe#order-book-streams):

  * `owner_funds` (string): Numeric amount of the `TakerGets` currency that the `Account` sending this OfferCreate transaction has after the execution of all transactions in this ledger. This does not check whether the currency amount is [frozen](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes).

## `ledger_data`

> Retrieves the raw contents of a ledger version.

The `ledger_data` method retrieves contents of the specified ledger. You can iterate through several calls to retrieve the entire contents of a single ledger version.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `ledger_hash` (string — [hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): A 20-byte hex string identifying the ledger version to use.
    * `ledger_index` (number or string; optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers).)
    * `binary` (boolean; optional): If `true`, return ledger entries as hexadecimal strings instead of JSON. The default is `false`.
    * `limit` (number; optional): Limit the number of ledger entries to retrieve. The server may return fewer than this number of entries. Cannot be more than 2048 (when requesting binary) or 256 (when requesting JSON). Positive values outside this range are replaced with the closest valid option. The default is the maximum.
    * `marker` (string — [marker](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/markers-and-pagination); optional): Value from a previous paginated response. Resume retrieving data where that response left off.
    * `type` (string; optional): Filter results to a specific type of ledger entry. This field accepts canonical names of [ledger entry types](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types) (case-insensitive) or [short names](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/ledger-entry-short-names). If omitted, return ledger entries of all types.

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `ledger_index` (unsigned integer — [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index)): The ledger index of this ledger version.
  * `ledger_hash` (string — [hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes)): Unique identifying hash of this ledger version.
  * `state` (array): Array of JSON objects containing data from the ledger's state tree, as defined below.
  * `marker` (string — [marker](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/markers-and-pagination)): Server-defined value indicating the response is paginated. Pass this to the next call to resume where this call left off.

If a `type` field is mentioned in the request, the `state` array will be empty if the first set of array objects does not match the type requested. In such cases, you can use the `marker` from this response to paginate and retrieve further data.

The format of each object in the `state` array depends on whether `binary` was set to true or not in the request. Each `state` object may include the following fields:

  * `data` (string): (Only included if `"binary": true`) Hex representation of the requested data.
  * `LedgerEntryType` (string): (Only included if `"binary": false`) String indicating what type of ledger object this object represents. See [ledger object types](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types) for the full list.
  * **(Additional fields)** (various): (Only included if `"binary": false`) Additional fields describing this object, depending on which [ledger object type](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types) it is.
  * `index` (string): Unique identifier for this ledger entry, as hex.

## `ledger_entry`

> Retrieves a single item from a ledger version.

The `ledger_entry` method returns a single ledger entry from the XRP Ledger in its raw format. See [ledger format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types) for information on the different types of entries you can retrieve.

### Request format

This method can retrieve several distinct types of data. You can select which type of item to retrieve by passing the appropriate parameters, comprised of the general and type-specific fields listed below, and following the standard [request formatting](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/request-formatting). (For example, a WebSocket request always has the `command` field and optionally an id field, and a JSON-RPC request uses the `method` and `params` fields.)

#### General fields

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `binary` (boolean; optional): If `true`, return the requested ledger entry's contents as a hex string in the XRP Ledger's [binary format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format). Otherwise, return data in JSON format. The default is `false`.
    * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): The unique hash of the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers).)
    * `ledger_index` (string or unsigned integer; optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string (e.g. "validated", "closed", or "current") to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers).)
    * `include_deleted` (boolean; optional, Clio servers only): If set to `true` and the queried object has been deleted, returns its complete data as it was prior to its deletion. If set to `false` or not provided, and the queried object has been deleted, returns `objectNotFound` (current behavior).

#### Specific fields

In addition to the general fields above, you must specify exactly 1 of the specific fields to indicate what type of entry to retrieve, along with its sub-fields as appropriate. The valid fields are:

  * [Get Ledger Entry by ID]()
  * [Get AccountRoot Entry]()
  * [Get AMM Entry]()
  * [Get Bridge Entry]()
  * [Get Credential Entry]()
  * [Get DirectoryNode Entry]()
  * [Get Offer Entry]()

  * [Get Ticket Entry]()
  * [Get NFT Page]()
  * [Get MPT Issuance Object]()
  * [Get MPToken Object]()

#### Get Ledger Entry by ID

Retrieve any type of ledger entry by its unique ID.

##### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `index` (string): The [ledger entry ID](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/common-fields) of a single entry to retrieve from the ledger, as a 64-character (256-bit) hexadecimal string.

##### Request example

**Transaction Methods**:

Transactions are the only thing that can modify the shared state of the XRP Ledger. All business on the XRP Ledger takes the form of transactions. Use these methods to work with transactions.

## `simulate`

> Executes a dry run of any transaction type to preview results and metadata.

The `simulate` method executes a dry run of any transaction type, enabling you to preview the results and metadata of a transaction without committing them to the XRP Ledger. Since this command never submits a transaction to the network, it doesn't incur any fees.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `tx_blob` (string; required): The transaction to simulate, in binary format. If you include this field, do not also include `tx_json`.
    * `tx_json` (object; required): The transaction to simulate, in JSON format. If you include this field, do not also include `tx_blob`.
    * `binary` (boolean; optional): The default value is `false`, which returns data and metadata in JSON format. If `true`, returns data and metadata in binary format, serialized to a hexadecimal string.

Note:

  * The simulated transaction must be unsigned.
  * If the `Fee`, `Sequence`, `SigningPubKey`, or `NetworkID` fields are provided, they will be used in the transaction. Otherwise, the server will autofill them.

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `tx_json` (object): The transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `false`.
  * `tx_blob` (string): The serialized transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `true`.
  * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index)): The ledger index of the ledger that would have included this transaction.
  * `meta` (object): Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `false`.
  * `meta_blob` (string): Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `true`.

## `submit`

> Sends a transaction to the network.

The `submit` method applies a [transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions) and sends it to the network to be confirmed and included in future ledgers.

This command has two modes:

  * **Submit-only** mode takes a signed, serialized transaction as a binary blob, and submits it to the network as-is. Since signed transaction objects are immutable, no part of the transaction can be modified or automatically filled in after submission.

  * **Sign-and-submit** mode takes a JSON-formatted Transaction object, completes and signs the transaction in the same manner as the [sign method](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/admin-api-methods/signing-methods/sign), and then submits the signed transaction. We recommend only using this mode for testing and development.

To send a transaction as robustly as possible, you should construct and sign it in advance, persist it somewhere that you can access even after a power outage, then `submit` it as a `tx_blob`. After submission, monitor the network with the tx method command to see if the transaction was successfully applied; if a restart or other problem occurs, you can safely re-submit the `tx_blob` transaction: it won't be applied twice since it has the same sequence number as the old transaction.

### Submit-only mode

#### Parameters

A submit-only request includes the following parameters:

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `tx_blob` (string; required): Hex representation of the signed transaction to submit. This can be a [multi-signed transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/multi-signing).
    * `fail_hard` (boolean; optional): If `true`, and the transaction fails locally, do not retry or relay the transaction to other servers. The default is `false`.

#### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `engine_result` (string): Text [result code](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results) indicating the preliminary result of the transaction, for example `tesSUCCESS`.
  * `engine_result_code` (integer): Numeric version of the [result code](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results). Not recommended.
  * `engine_result_message` (string): Human-readable explanation of the transaction's preliminary result.
  * `tx_blob` (string): The complete transaction in hex string format.
  * `tx_json` (object): The complete transaction in JSON format.
  * `accepted` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that the transaction was applied, queued, broadcast, or kept for later. The value `false` indicates that none of those happened, so the transaction cannot possibly succeed as long as you do not submit it again and have not already submitted it another time.
  * `account_sequence_available` (number; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The next [Sequence Number](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#account-sequence) available for the sending account after all pending and [queued transactions](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `account_sequence_next` (number; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The next [Sequence Number](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#account-sequence) for the sending account after all transactions that have been provisionally applied, but not transactions in the [queue](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `applied` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that this transaction was applied to the open ledger. In this case, the transaction is likely, but not guaranteed, to be validated in the next ledger version.
  * `broadcast` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates this transaction was broadcast to peer servers in the peer-to-peer XRP Ledger network. The value `false` indicates the transaction was not broadcast to any other servers.
  * `kept` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that the transaction was kept to be retried later.
  * `queued` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates the transaction was put in the [Transaction Queue](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue), which means it is likely to be included in a future ledger version.
  * `open_ledger_cost` (string; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The current [open ledger cost](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-cost#open-ledger-cost) before processing this transaction. Transactions with a lower cost are likely to be [queued](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `validated_ledger_index` (integer; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the newest validated ledger at the time of submission. This provides a lower bound on the ledger versions that the transaction can appear in as a result of this request.

### Sign-and-Submit mode

This mode signs a transaction and immediately submits it. This mode is intended to be used for testing. You cannot use this mode for [multi-signed transactions](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/multi-signing).

By default, sign-and-submit mode is [admin-only](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/admin-api-methods). It can be used as a public method if the server has [enabled public signing](https://xrpl.org/docs/infrastructure/configuration/enable-public-signing).

You can provide the secret key used to sign the transaction in the following ways:

  * Provide a `secret` value and omit the `key_type` field. This value can be formatted as an XRP Ledger [base58](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/base58-encodings) seed, RFC-1751, hexadecimal, or as a string passphrase. (secp256k1 keys only)
  * Provide a `key_type` value and exactly one of `seed`, `seed_hex`, or `passphrase`. Omit the `secret` field. (Not supported by the commandline syntax.)

#### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `tx_json` (object): [Transaction definition](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions) in JSON format, optionally omitting any auto-fillable fields.
    * `secret` (string; optional): Secret key of the account supplying the transaction, used to sign it. Do not send your secret to untrusted servers or through unsecured network connections. Cannot be used with `key_type`, `seed`, `seed_hex`, or `passphrase`.
    * `seed` (string; optional): Secret key of the account supplying the transaction, used to sign it. Must be in the XRP Ledger's base58 format. If provided, you must also specify the `key_type`. Cannot be used with `secret`, `seed_hex`, or `passphrase`.
    * `seed_hex` (string; optional): Secret key of the account supplying the transaction, used to sign it. Must be in hexadecimal format. If provided, you must also specify the `key_type`. Cannot be used with `secret`, `seed`, or `passphrase`.
    * `passphrase` (string; optional): Secret key of the account supplying the transaction, used to sign it, as a string passphrase. If provided, you must also specify the `key_type`. Cannot be used with `secret`, `seed`, or `seed_hex`.
    * `key_type` (string; optional): Type of cryptographic key provided in this request. Valid types are `secp256k1` or `ed25519`. Defaults to `secp256k1`. Cannot be used with `secret`. Caution: `Ed25519` support is experimental.
    * `fail_hard` (boolean; optional): If `true`, and the transaction fails locally, do not retry or relay the transaction to other servers. The default is `false`.
    * `offline` (boolean; optional): If `true`, when constructing the transaction, do not try to automatically fill in or validate values. The default is `false`.
    * `build_path` (boolean; optional): If this field is provided, the server [auto-fills](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/common-fields#auto-fillable-fields) the Paths field of a [Payment transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/payment) before signing. You must omit this field if the transaction is a [direct XRP payment](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/direct-xrp-payments) or if it is not a Payment-type transaction. Caution: The server looks for the presence or absence of this field, not its value. This behavior may change.
    * `fee_mult_max` (integer; optional): Sign-and-submit fails with the error `rpcHIGH_FEE` if the [auto-filled `Fee` value](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/common-fields#auto-fillable-fields) would be greater than the [reference transaction cost](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-cost#special-transaction-costs) × `fee_mult_max` ÷ `fee_div_max`. This field has no effect if you explicitly specify the Fee field of the transaction. The default is `10`.
    * `fee_div_max` (integer; optional): Sign-and-submit fails with the error `rpcHIGH_FEE` if the [auto-filled `Fee` value](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/common-fields#auto-fillable-fields) would be greater than the [reference transaction cost](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-cost#special-transaction-costs) × `fee_mult_max` ÷ `fee_div_max`. This field has no effect if you explicitly specify the Fee field of the transaction. The default is `1`.

#### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `engine_result` (string): Text [result code](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results) indicating the preliminary result of the transaction, for example `tesSUCCESS`.
  * `engine_result_code` (integer): Numeric version of the [result code](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results). Not recommended.
  * `engine_result_message` (string): Human-readable explanation of the transaction's preliminary result.
  * `tx_blob` (string): The complete transaction in hex string format.
  * `tx_json` (object): The complete transaction in JSON format.
  * `accepted` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that the transaction was applied, queued, broadcast, or kept for later. The value `false` indicates that none of those happened, so the transaction cannot possibly succeed as long as you do not submit it again and have not already submitted it another time.
  * `account_sequence_available` (number; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The next [Sequence Number](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#account-sequence) available for the sending account after all pending and [queued transactions](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `account_sequence_next` (number; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The next [Sequence Number](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#account-sequence) for the sending account after all transactions that have been provisionally applied, but not transactions in the [queue](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `applied` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that this transaction was applied to the open ledger. In this case, the transaction is likely, but not guaranteed, to be validated in the next ledger version.
  * `broadcast` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates this transaction was broadcast to peer servers in the peer-to-peer XRP Ledger network. The value `false` indicates the transaction was not broadcast to any other servers.
  * `kept` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates that the transaction was kept to be retried later.
  * `queued` (boolean; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The value `true` indicates the transaction was put in the [Transaction Queue](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue), which means it is likely to be included in a future ledger version.
  * `open_ledger_cost` (string; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The current [open ledger cost](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-cost#open-ledger-cost) before processing this transaction. Transactions with a lower cost are likely to be [queued](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/transactions/transaction-queue).
  * `validated_ledger_index` (integer; omitted in sign-and-submit mode): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the newest validated ledger at the time of submission. This provides a lower bound on the ledger versions that the transaction can appear in as a result of this request.

## `submit_multisigned`

> Sends a multi-signed transaction to the network.

The `submit_multisigned` command applies a [multi-signed](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/multi-signing) transaction and sends it to the network to be included in future ledgers. (You can also submit multi-signed transactions in binary form using the `submit` command in ???submit-only mode???.)

  * `params` (array; required):

    * `tx_json` (object; required): [Transaction in JSON format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions) with an array of `Signers`. To be successful, the weights of the signatures must be equal or higher than the quorum of the [SignerList](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/signerlist).
    * `fail_hard` (boolean; optional): If `true`, and the transaction fails locally, do not retry or relay the transaction to other servers. The default is `false`.

**Path and Order Book Methods**:

Paths define a way for payments to flow through intermediary steps on their way from sender to receiver. Paths enable cross-currency payments by connecting sender and receiver through order books. Use these methods to work with paths and other books.

## `amm_info`

> Retrieves info on the Automated Market Maker (AMM) instance.

The `amm_info` method gets information about an [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/automated-market-makers) instance.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).

    * `amm_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); optional): The address of the AMM's special AccountRoot. (This is the `issuer` of the AMM's LP Tokens.)
    * `asset` (object; optional): One of the assets of the AMM to look up, as an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit issuer for XRP), like [currency amounts](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts).
    * `asset2` (object; optional): The other of the assets of the AMM, as an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP), like [currency amounts](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts).

Note: You must specify either `amm_account` or both `asset` and `asset2`.

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `amm` (object): An AMM Description Object for the requested asset pair.
  * `ledger_current_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): Omitted if `ledger_index` is provided instead. The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the current in-progress ledger, which was used when retrieving this information.
  * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): Omitted if `ledger_current_index` is provided instead. The identifying hash of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data.
  * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): Omitted if `ledger_current_index` is provided instead. The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger version used when retrieving this information.
  * `validated` (boolean): If `true`, the ledger used for this request is validated and these results are final; if omitted or set to `false`, the data is pending and may change.

#### AMM Description Object

The `amm` field is an object describing the current status of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in the ledger, and contains the following fields:

  * `account` (string): The [Address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses) of the AMM Account.
  * `amount` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts)): The total amount of one asset in the AMM's pool. (Note: This could be `asset` or `asset2` from the request.)
  * `amount2` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts)): The total amount of the other asset in the AMM's pool. (Note: This could be `asset` or `asset2` from the request.)
  * `asset_frozen` (boolean; omitted for XRP): If `true`, the `amount` currency is currently [frozen](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes).
  * `asset2_frozen` (boolean; omitted for XRP): If `true`, the `amount2` currency is currently [frozen](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/freezes).
  * `auction_slot` (object; optional): An Auction Slot Object describing the current auction slot holder, if there is one.
  * `lp_token` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts)): The total amount of this AMM's LP Tokens outstanding. If the request specified a liquidity provider in the `account` field, instead, this is the amount of this AMM's LP Tokens held by that liquidity provider.
  * `trading_fee` (number): The AMM's current trading fee, in units of `1/100,000`; a value of `1` is equivalent to a `0.001%` fee.
  * `vote_slots` (array; optional): The current votes for the AMM's trading fee, as Vote Slot Objects.

#### Auction Slot Object

The `auction_slot` field of the `amm` object describes the current auction slot holder of the AMM, and contains the following fields:

  * `account` (string): The [Address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses) of the account that owns the auction slot.
  * `auth_accounts` (array): A list of additional accounts that the auction slot holder has designated as being eligible of the discounted trading fee. Each member of this array is an object with one field, `account`, containing the address of the designated account.
  * `discounted_fee` (number): The discounted trading fee that applies to the auction slot holder, and any eligible accounts, when trading against this AMM. This is `1/10` of the AMM's normal trading fee.
  * `expiration` (string): The ISO 8601 UTC timestamp after which this auction slot expires. After expired, the auction slot does not apply (but the data can remain in the ledger until another transaction replaces it or cleans it up).
  * `price` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts)): The amount, in LP Tokens, that the auction slot holder paid to win the auction slot. This affects the price to outbid the current slot holder.
  * `time_interval` (number): The current 72-minute time interval this auction slot is in, from 0 to 19. The auction slot expires after 24 hours (20 intervals of 72 minutes) and affects the cost to outbid the current holder and how much the current holder is refunded if someone outbids them.

#### Vote Slot Objects

Each entry in the `vote_slots` array represents one liquidity provider's vote to set the trading fee, and contains the following fields:

  * `account` (string): The [Address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses) of this liquidity provider.
  * `trading_fee` (number): The trading fee this liquidity provider voted for, in units of `1/100,000`.
  * `vote_weight` (number): How much this liquidity provider's vote counts towards the final trading fee. This is proportional to how much of the AMM's LP Tokens this liquidity provider holds. The value is equal to `100,000` times the number of this LP Tokens this liquidity provider holds, divided by the total number of LP Tokens outstanding. For example, a value of `1000` means that the liquidity provider holds `1%` of this AMM's LP Tokens.

## `book_changes`

> Retrieves information on order book changes.

The `book_changes` method reports information about changes to the order books in the [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange) compared with the previous ledger version. This may be useful for building "candlestick" charts.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): A 32-byte hex string for the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `changes` (array): List of [Book Update Objects](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/path-and-order-book-methods/book_changes#book-update-objects), containing one entry for each order book that was updated in this ledger version. The array is empty if no order books were updated.
  * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes)): The identifying hash of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data.
  * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index)): The ledger index of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data.
  * `ledger_time` (number): The official close time of the ledger that was used when retrieving this data, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-time).
  * `type` (string): The string `bookChanges`, which indicates that this is an order book update message.
  * `validated` (boolean; optional): If `true`, the information comes from a validated ledger version.

#### Book Update Objects

A Book Update Object represents the changes to a single order book in a single ledger version, and contains the following fields:

  * `currency_a` (string): An identifier for the first of the two currencies in the order book. For XRP, this is the string `XRP_drops`. For [tokens](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens), this is formatted as the address of the issuer in base58, followed by a forward-slash (`/`), followed by the [Currency Code](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/currency-formats#currency-codes) for the token, which can be a 3-character standard code or a 20-character hexadecimal code.
  * `currency_b` (string): An identifier for the second of two currencies in the order book. This is in the same format as `currency_a`, except `currency_b` can never be XRP.
  * `volume_a` (string — number): The total amount, or volume, of the first currency (that is, `currency_a`) that moved as a result of trades through this order book in this ledger.
  * `volume_b` (string — number): The volume of the second currency (that is, `currency_b`) that moved as a result of trades through this order book in this ledger.
  * `high` (string — number): The highest exchange rate among all offers matched in this ledger, as a ratio of the first currency to the second currency. (In other words, `currency_a : currency_b`.)
  * `low` (string — number): The lowest exchange rate among all offers matched in this ledger, as a ratio of the first currency to the second currency.
  * `open` (string — number): The exchange rate at the top of this order book before processing the transactions in this ledger, as a ratio of the first currency to the second currency.
  * `close` (string — number): The exchange rate at the top of this order book after processing the transactions in this ledger, as a ratio of the first currency to the second currency.

For XRP-token order books, XRP is always `currency_a`. For token-token order books, the currencies are sorted alphabetically by the issuer and then currency code.

Exchange rates involving XRP are always calculated using [drops of XRP](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts). For example, if the rate from XRP to FOO is 1.0 XRP to 1 FOO, the rate reported by the API is `1000000` (1 million drops of XRP per 1 FOO).

## `book_offers`

> Retrieves info on the currency exchange offers.

The `book_offers` method retrieves a list of [offers](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/offers) between two currencies, also known as an order book. The response omits [unfunded offers](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/offers#lifecycle-of-an-offer) and reports how much of each remaining offer's total is currently funded.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `taker_gets` (object; required): The asset the account taking the offer would receive, as a [currency without an amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/currency-formats#specifying-without-amounts).
    * `taker_pays` (object; required): The asset the account taking the offer would pay, as a [currency without an amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/currency-formats#specifying-without-amounts).
    * `domain` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): The ledger entry ID of a permissioned domain. If provided, return offers from the corresponding [permissioned DEX](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/permissioned-dexes) instead of using the open DEX. (Requires the [PermissionedDEX amendment](https://xrpl.org/resources/known-amendments#permissioneddex). Open for Voting: 48.57%)
    * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): The unique hash of the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `limit` (number; optional): The maximum number of offers to return. The response may include fewer results.
    * `taker` (string; optional): The [Address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses) of an account to use as a perspective. The response includes this account's Offers even if they are unfunded. (You can use this to see what Offers are above or below yours in the order book.)

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `ledger_current_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): Omitted if `ledger_index` is provided. The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the current in-progress ledger version, which was used to retrieve this information.
  * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): Omitted if `ledger_current_index` is provided. The ledger index of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data, as requested.
  * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): The identifying hash of the ledger version that was used when retrieving this data, as requested.
  * `offers` (array): Array of offer objects, as described below.

Each member of the `offers` array contains canonical fields of an [Offer entry](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/offer) and can also contain the following additional fields:

  * `owner_funds` (string): Amount of the `TakerGets` currency the side placing the offer has available to be traded. (XRP is represented as drops; any other currency is represented as a decimal value.) If a trader has multiple offers in the same book, only the highest-ranked offer includes this field.
  * `taker_gets_funded` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts); optional): (Only included in partially-funded offers) The maximum amount of currency that the taker can get, given the funding status of the offer.
  * `taker_pays_funded` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts); optional): (Only included in partially-funded offers) The maximum amount of currency that the taker would pay, given the funding status of the offer.
  * `quality` (string): The exchange rate, as the ratio `taker_pays` divided by `taker_gets`. For fairness, offers that have the same quality are automatically taken first-in, first-out. (In other words, if multiple people offer to exchange currency at the same rate, the oldest offer is taken first.)

## `deposit_authorized`

> Checks whether an account is authorized to send money directly to another account.

The `deposit_authorized` command indicates whether one account is authorized to send payments directly to another. See [Deposit Authorization](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/depositauth) for information on how to require authorization to deliver money to your account.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `source_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The sender of a possible payment.
    * `destination_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The recipient of a possible payment.
    * `ledger_hash` ([hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): A 32-byte hex string for the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `credentials` (array; optional): A set of credentials to take into account when checking if the sender can send funds to the destination. Each member of the array must be the unique ID of a [Credential entry](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/ledger-data/ledger-entry-types/credential) in the ledger. Cannot be an empty array.

Note: If you provide a set of credentials that does not exactly match a set of credentials preauthorized by the destination, the payment is not authorized, even if the destination has preauthorized a subset of those credentials. This matches the behavior of transaction processing.

  * `deposit_authorized` (boolean; required): Whether the specified source account is authorized to send payments directly to the destination account. If `true`, either the destination account does not require [deposit authorization](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/depositauth) or the source account is preauthorized.
  * `destination_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The destination account specified in the request.
  * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): The identifying hash of the ledger that was used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_index` (number — [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The ledger index of the ledger version that was used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_current_index` (number — [ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The ledger index of the current in-progress ledger version, which was used to generate this response.
  * `source_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The source account specified in the request.
  * `validated` (boolean; optional): If `true`, the information comes from a validated ledger version.

    * `trim_threshold` (number; optional): Defines a time range in seconds for filtering out older price data. Default value is 0, which doesn't filter any data.
    * `oracles` (array; required): An array of oracle identifier objects. You must list between 1 and 200 oracle identifiers.

Each member of the `oracles` array is an oracle identifier object with the following fields:

  * `account` (string; required): The XRPL account that controls the `Oracle` object.
  * `oracle_document_id` (number; required): A unique identifier of the price oracle for the `Account`.

### Returns

  * `entire_set` (object): The statistics from the collected oracle prices.
    * `entire_set.mean` (string — number): The simple mean.
    * `entire_set.size` (number): The size of the data set to calculate the mean.
    * `entire_set.standard_deviation` (string — number): The standard deviation.
  * `trimmed_set` (object; optional): The trimmed statistics from the collected oracle prices. Only appears if the `trim` field was specified in the request.
    * `trimmed_set.mean` (string — number): The simple mean of the trimmed data.
    * `trimmed_set.size` (number): The size of the data to calculate the trimmed mean.

## `ripple_path_find`

> Finds a path for payment between two accounts, once.

Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path or combination of paths for making a payment, it is not guaranteed that the paths returned by this method are, in fact, the best paths.

Caution: Be careful with the pathfinding results from untrusted servers. A server could be modified to return less-than-optimal paths to earn money for its operators. A server may also return poor results when under heavy load. If you do not have your own server that you can trust with pathfinding, you should compare the results of pathfinding from multiple servers run by different parties, to minimize the risk of a single server returning poor results.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON-RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `source_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The account that would send funds.
    * `destination_account` (string — [address](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#addresses); required): The account that would receive funds.
    * `destination_amount` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts); required): How much the destination account would receive. Special case: You can specify `-1` (for XRP) or provide `-1` as the `value` field (for tokens). This requests a path to deliver as much as possible, while spending no more than the amount specified in `send_max` (if provided).
    * `domain` (string — [hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): The ledger entry ID of a permissioned domain. If provided, only return paths that use the corresponding [permissioned DEX](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange/permissioned-dexes). (Requires the [PermissionedDEX amendment](https://xrpl.org/resources/known-amendments#permissioneddex))
    * `ledger_hash` (string — [hash](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes); optional): The unique hash of the ledger version to use. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `ledger_index` ([ledger index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index); optional): The ledger index of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically. (See [Specifying Ledgers](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-ledgers))
    * `send_max` ([currency amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts); optional): Maximum amount that would be spent. Cannot be used with `source_currencies`.
    * `source_currencies` (array; optional): Array of currencies that the source account might want to spend. Each entry in the array should be a JSON object with a mandatory `currency` field and optional `issuer` field, like how [currency amounts](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts) are specified. Cannot contain more than 18 source currencies. By default, uses all source currencies available up to a maximum of 88 different currency/issuer pairs.

### Returns

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `alternatives` (array): Array of objects with possible paths to take, as described below. If empty, then there are no paths connecting the source and destination accounts.
  * `destination_account` (string): Unique address of the account that would receive a payment transaction.
  * `destination_currencies` (array): Array of strings representing the currencies that the destination accepts, as 3-letter codes like `USD` or as 40-character hex like `015841551A748AD2C1F76FF6ECB0CCCD00000000`.

Each element in the `alternatives` array is an object that represents a path from one possible source currency (held by the initiating account) to the destination account and currency. This object has the following fields:

  * `paths_computed` (array): Array of arrays of objects defining [payment paths](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/paths).
  * `source_amount` (string or object): [Currency Amount](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts) that the source would have to send along this path for the destination to receive the desired amount.

The `channel_verify` method checks the validity of a signature that can be used to redeem a specific amount of XRP from a payment channel.

### Parameters

  * `amount` (string; required): The amount of [XRP, in drops](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#specifying-currency-amounts), that the provided `signature` authorizes.
  * `channel_id` (string; required): The Channel ID of the channel that provides the amount. This is a 64-character hexadecimal string.
  * `public_key` (string; required): The public key of the channel and the key pair that was used to create the signature, in hexadecimal or the XRP Ledger's `base58` format.
  * `signature` (string; required): The signature to verify, in hexadecimal.

### Returns

  * `signature_verified` (boolean): If `true`, the signature is valid for the stated amount, channel, and public key.

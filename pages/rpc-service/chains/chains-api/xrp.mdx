# XRP

> XRP API is available on [Web3 API platform](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/xrp).



In order for your Web3 application to interact with XRP — either by reading blockchain data or sending transactions to the network — it must connect to an XRP node. Developers interact with the blockchain using the methods provided by the API.

The API interaction follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) which is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in other message-passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## Methods supported

**Account Methods**:

An account in the XRP Ledger represents a holder of XRP and a sender of transactions. Use these methods to work with account info.

  * [`account_channels`]() — retrieves a list of payment channels where the account is the source of the channel.

**Account Methods**:

An account in the XRP Ledger represents a holder of XRP and a sender of transactions. Use these methods to work with account info.

## `account_channels`

> Retrieves a list of payment channels where the account is the source of the channel.

The `account_channels` method returns information about an account's Payment Channels. This includes only channels where the specified account is the channel's source, not the destination. (A channel's "source" and "owner" are the same.) All information retrieved is relative to a particular version of the ledger.

### Parameters

  * `id` (integer; required): a request ID (example: 1).
  * `jsonrpc` (string; required): a JSON RPC spec used (example: 2.0).
  * `method` (string; required): a method used for the request.
  * `params` (array; required):

    * `account` (string — address???; required): look up channels where this account is the channel’s owner/source.
    * `destination_account` (string — address???; optional): a second account; if provided, filters results to payment channels whose destination is this account.
    * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): the unique hash of the ledger version to use (see Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `ledger_index` (number or string; optional): the ledger index of the ledger to use, or a shortcut string to choose a ledger automatically (see Specifying Ledgers???).
    * `limit` (number; optional): limits the number of transactions to retrieve. Must be between 10 and 400; values outside this range are adjusted to the nearest valid value. Default: 200.
    * `marker` (string — marker???; optional): value from a previous paginated response; resumes retrieving data where that response left off.

### Returns

The response follows the standard format???, with a successful result containing the following fields:

  * `account` (string): the address of the source/owner of the payment channels. Corresponds to the `account` field of the request.
  * `channels` (array of objects): list of payment channels owned by this `account`. Each object contains the following fields:
    * `account` (string): the owner of the channel, as an address???.
    * `channel_id` (string): a unique ID for this channel, represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string. This is also the ???ID of the channel object??? in the ledger’s state data.
    * `destination_account` (string): the destination account of the channel, as an address. Only this account can receive the `amount` in the channel while it is open.
    * `settle_delay` (unsigned integer): the number of seconds the payment channel must remain open after the owner requests to close it.
    * `public_key` (string; optional): the public key for the payment channel in the XRP Ledger’s base58??? format. Signed claims against this channel must be redeemed with the matching key pair.
    * `public_key_hex` (string; optional): the public key for the payment channel in hexadecimal format, if one was specified at channel creation. Signed claims against this channel must be redeemed with the matching key pair.
    * `expiration` (unsigned integer; optional): time in ???seconds since the Ripple Epoch??? when this channel is set to expire. This expiration date is mutable. If this value is before the close time of the most recent validated ledger, the channel is expired.
    * `cancel_after` (unsigned integer; optional): time in ???seconds since the Ripple Epoch??? representing this channel’s immutable expiration, if one was specified at creation. If this is before the close time of the most recent validated ledger, the channel is expired.
    * `source_tag` (unsigned integer; optional): a 32-bit unsigned integer used as a ???source tag??? for payments through this payment channel, if specified at creation. This indicates the channel’s originator or purpose. Conventionally, if you bounce payments from this channel, you should include this value in the `DestinationTag` of the return payment.
    * `destination_tag` (unsigned integer; optional): a 32-bit unsigned integer used as a ???destination tag??? for payments through this payment channel, if specified at creation. This indicates the payment channel’s beneficiary or purpose at the destination account.
  * `ledger_hash` (string; optional): the identifying hash??? of the ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `ledger_index` (number): the ledger index??? of the ledger version used to generate this response.
  * `validated` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the information in this response comes from a validated ledger version; otherwise, the information is subject to change.

Describes the local rippled server’s queue state, which may differ across the network. Some fields may be omitted because certain values are computed lazily by the queuing mechanism. Contains the following nested fields:
    * `txn_count` (integer): number of queued transactions from this address.
    * `auth_change_queued` (boolean; optional): whether a transaction in the queue changes this address’s ???ways of authorizing transactions???. If `true`, no further transactions can be queued until that transaction executes or drops from the queue.
    * `lowest_sequence` (integer; optional): the lowest ???sequence number??? among transactions queued by this address.
    * `highest_sequence` (integer; optional): the highest ???sequence number??? among transactions queued by this address.
    * `max_spend_drops_total` (string; optional): the total number of ???drops of XRP??? that could be debited from this account if every queued transaction consumes the maximum possible amount.

    * `peer` (string — address???; optional): a second account; if provided, filters results to trust lines connecting the two accounts.

### Returns

The response follows the ???standard format???, with a successful result containing the address of the account and an array of trust line objects. Specifically, the result object contains the following fields:

  * `account` (string): the unique ???address??? of the account this request corresponds to — the perspective account for the listed trust lines.
  * `lines` (array of objects): array of trust line objects associated with the specified account. If the number of trust lines is large, only returns up to the limit at a time. Each object contains the following fields:

    * `account` (string — ???address???): the counterparty to this trust line.
    * `balance` (string — number???): the current balance held on this line.
      * A positive balance indicates that the perspective account holds value.
      * A negative balance indicates that the perspective account owes value.
    * `currency` (string — ???currency code???): the currency code of the token that this trust line represents.
    * `limit` (string — ???number???): the maximum amount of the given currency that this account is willing to owe the peer account.
    * `limit_peer` (string — number???): the maximum amount of the given currency that the counterparty is willing to owe the perspective account.
    * `quality_in` (number): rate at which the account values incoming balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. For example, a value of 500 million represents a `0.5:1` ratio. As a special case, 0 is treated as a `1:1` ratio.
    * `quality_out` (number): rate at which the account values outgoing balances on this trust line, as a ratio of this value per 1 billion units. For example, a value of 500 million represents a `0.5:1` ratio. As a special case, 0 is treated as a `1:1` ratio.
    * `no_ripple` (boolean; optional): if `true`, this account has enabled the ???No Ripple flag??? for this trust line. If `false`, the flag is disabled, but this is not considered default??? when Default Ripple is also disabled. If omitted, No Ripple is disabled and Default Ripple is enabled.
    * `no_ripple_peer` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the peer account has enabled the ???No Ripple flag??? for this trust line. If `false`, the flag is disabled, but this is not considered ???default??? when Default Ripple is also disabled. If omitted, No Ripple is disabled and Default Ripple is enabled.
    * `authorized` (boolean; optional): if true, the perspective account ???has authorized this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `peer_authorized` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the counterparty ???has authorized this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `freeze` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the perspective account ???has frozen this trust line???. Default: `false`.
    * `freeze_peer` (boolean; optional): if `true`, the counterparty ???has frozen this trust line???. Default: `false`.

  * `ledger_current_index` (integer; optional): the ???ledger index??? used when retrieving this data. Present only when using an open ledger version.
  * `ledger_index` (integer; optional): the ???ledger index??? used when retrieving this data. Present only when using a closed ledger version.
  * `ledger_hash` (string — ???hash; optional): the identifying hash of the ledger version used when retrieving this data. This field is only provided when using a closed ledger version.
  * `marker` (string — marker???; optional): server-defined value indicating pagination; pass this to the next call to resume retrieving results from where this response ended. Omitted when there are no additional pages.
  * `limit` (number; optional): the maximum number of trust lines retrieved. The server may return fewer than the specified limit even if more results are available. Default: `200`.

# Basics with Public plan

What's available for the [Public service plan](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) user:

  * Node API at the corresponding [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits).
  * Connection code snippets.
  * Public usage data (stats on requests from all Public service users).

## Use public endpoints

To enable your project to interact with a blockchain, add the blockchain's endpoint into the project's library or config file:

1. In **Navigation**, click **Chains List** to open the pane.
2. In **Chains List**, locate and click a chain you'd like to query.

3. In the **Chain** opened, select a network (**Mainnet**/**Testnet**) required for your project.

4. In the **HTTPS Endpoint** field, copy the URL and paste it into your project's library or config file.

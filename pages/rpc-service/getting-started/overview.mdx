# Overview

*RPC Service* — a platform that enables users to empower their Web3 projects with the blockchain interaction capabilities ([35+ chains supported](/rpc-service/chains/chains-list/)) via the top-performing globally-distributed decentralized infrastructure of nodes.

The **Getting Started** docs walk you through the following items:

  * [RPC Service interface schema](/rpc-service/getting-started/overview/#interface-schema) — get to know the RPC Service interface.
  * [Public plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-public/) — get to know your way around Public endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Premium plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/) — get to know your way around Premium endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Business accounts](/rpc-service/getting-started/my-business/) — get to know your way around user accounts that help structuring your business.
  * [Projects](/rpc-service/getting-started/projects/) — get to know your way around creating multiple projects with unique tokens for traffic distribution.

## Interface schema

Here you'll find information on what you can expect from all the main panes you're working with on the RPC Service platform.

### Endpoints

Once you type down `ankr.com/rpc` in your browser and press `Enter`, you'll find yourself in the **Endpoints** pane. This is your starting point to empower your Web3 project with blockchain interaction capabilities.
<br/>

You usually start as a [Public plan](/rpc-service/service-plans/) user, meaning that you haven't signed in to our platform yet and can only use free RPC API endpoints and Advanced APIs with the corresponding [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits) available.

For a Public plan user, the following actions are available from the start:

  * **Navigation** — selecting the pane to work with.
  * **User authentication** — logging into the platform to use [Premium capabilities](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/).
  * **Chains selection** — selecting the chain to [use public endpoints](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-public/#use-public-endpoints) for your project's blockchain interaction.

### Advanced APIs

<Callout type="tip">
Research on Advanced APIs [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits) supported by our service plans.
</Callout>

The Advanced APIs (AAPIs) functionality is intended for more savvy and demanding users. Advanced APIs optimize, index, cache, and store blockchain data to make it access-ready for you. Some AAPIs methods support simultaneous querying of multiple EVM-compatible blockchains in a single request.
<br/>

<img src="/docs/build/aapi.png" alt="Advanced APIs pane" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

So, as a Premium user, in **Navigation** you've clicked **Advanced APIs** and found yourself in the corresponding pane.

Here is your set of options for that scenario:

  * **AAPIs endpoint** — your Premium endpoint for AAPIs interaction.
  * **Useful links** — open the [Advanced APIs docs](/advanced-api/overview/) or our [JS](/advanced-api/javascript-sdk/) and [Python](/advanced-api/python-sdk/) SDKs enabling interaction with AAPIs.
  * **Code samples** — the basis for AAPIs interaction.

### Dashboard

<Callout type="tip">
Available for [Premium](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) users only.
</Callout>

To open the **Dashboard** pane, follow these steps:

1. [Sign in](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in) to the [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform.
2. In **Navigation**, click **Dashboard** to open the corresponding pane.

Congrats — you can see **Dashboard** statistics.
<br/>

In **Dashboard**, you can monitor and filter (by hours/days and chains) the following statistics data:

  * **Requests** — a diagram of total requests.
  * **Requests by IP** — a list of IP addresses with the number of requests for each of them.
  * **Chain Calls** — a total number of chain requests and percentage for each chain.
  * **Projects** — projects used for chain requests.
  * **Available Locations** — node locations for each chain.
  * **Top Countries** — a list of countries the requests come from.
  * **Usage History** — a number of chain requests by month.

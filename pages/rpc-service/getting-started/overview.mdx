The **Getting Started** docs walk you through the following items:

  * [RPC Service interface schema](/rpc-service/getting-started/overview/#interface-schema) — get to know the RPC Service interface.
  * [Public plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-public/) — get to know your way around Public endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Premium plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/) — get to know your way around Premium endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Business accounts](/rpc-service/getting-started/my-business/) — get to know your way around user accounts that help structuring your business.

## Interface schema

Here you'll find information on what you can expect from all the main sections you're working with on the RPC Service platform.

### Home screen

Once you type down `ankr.com/rpc` in your browser and hit `Enter`, you'll find yourself on the RPC Service home screen. This is your starting point to empower your Web3 project with blockchain interaction capabilities.

In **Dashboard**, you can monitor and filter (by hours/days and chains) the following statistics data:

  * **Requests** — a diagram of total requests.
  * **Requests by IP** — a list of IP addresses with the number of requests for each of them.
  * **Chain Calls** — a total number of chain requests and percentage for each chain.
  * **Projects** — projects used for chain requests.
  * **Available Locations** — node locations for each chain.
  * **Top Countries** — a list of countries the requests come from.
  * **Usage History** — a number of chain requests by month.

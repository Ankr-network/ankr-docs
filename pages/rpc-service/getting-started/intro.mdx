# Intro

The **Getting Started** docs walk you through the following items:

  * [RPC Service interface schema](/rpc-service/getting-started/intro/#interface-schema) — get to know the RPC Service interface.
  * [Public plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-public/) — get to know your way around Public endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Premium plan basics](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/) — get to know your way around Premium endpoints for blockchain interaction.
  * [Business accounts](/rpc-service/getting-started/business-accounts/) — get to know your way around user accounts that help structuring your business.
  * [Projects](/rpc-service/getting-started/projects/) — get to know your way around creating multiple projects with unique tokens for traffic distribution.

## Interface schema

Here you'll find information on what you can expect from all the main panes you're working with on the RPC Service platform.

### RPC/REST API

Once you type down `ankr.com/rpc` in your browser and press `Enter`, you'll find yourself in the **Endpoints** pane. This is your starting point to empower your Web3 project with blockchain interaction capabilities.
<br/>

You usually start as a [Public plan](/rpc-service/service-plans/) user, meaning that you haven't signed in to our platform yet and can only use free RPC API endpoints and Advanced API with the corresponding [features](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list) and [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits) available.

For a Public plan user, the following actions are available from the start:

  * **Navigation** — selecting the pane to work with.
  * **User authentication** — logging into the platform to use [Premium capabilities](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/).
  * **Chains selection** — selecting the chain to [use public endpoints](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-public/#use-public-endpoints) for your project's blockchain interaction.

### Advanced API

<Callout type="tip">
Research on Advanced API [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits) supported by our service plans.
</Callout>

The Advanced API (AAPI) functionality is intended for more savvy and demanding users. Advanced API optimizes, indexes, caches, and stores blockchain data to make it access-ready for you. Some AAPI methods support simultaneous querying of multiple EVM-compatible blockchains in a single request.
<br/>

<img src="/docs/build/aapi-gs.png" alt="Advanced API pane" class="responsive-pic" width="700" />

So, as a Premium user, in **Navigation** you've clicked **Advanced API** and found yourself in the corresponding pane.

Here is your set of options for that scenario:

  * **AAPI endpoint** — your Premium endpoint for AAPI interaction.
  * **Useful links** — open the [Advanced API docs](/advanced-api/overview/) or our [JS](/advanced-api/javascript-sdk/) and [Python](/advanced-api/python-sdk/) SDKs enabling interaction with AAPI.
  * **Code samples** — the basis for AAPI interaction.

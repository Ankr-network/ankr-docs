*Projects* is a feature that provides the means to use several unique tokens in private endpoints of a single user account and secure your project's user interaction by specifying a particular smart contract to communicate through. That might help with project structuring, interaction security, as well as with traffic distribution for the most demanding throughput.

In simple words, each new project provides a new unique token to be used in your private endpoints and specifies a particular smart contract for project communication.

The first iteration of Projects aims at providing you with the means to control your endpoint usage by `smart contract whitelisting`. This feature would be handy for a dApp where users communicate with a smart contract via Frontend — to protect your endpoint from misuse. A specified smart contract will allow your dApp users to request only a selected chain using a limited number of methods supported.

<Callout type="warning">
All requests using unsupported methods or chains get blocked.
</Callout>

**Supported chains**:

  * Arbitrum
  * BNB Smart Chain
  * Ethereum
  * Gnosis
  * Polygon

**Supported methods**:

  * `eth_call`
  * `eth_getLogs`
  * `eth_sendRawTransaction`

## Usage

You can use the *Projects* feature working with the following panes:

  * **Endpoints** / **Advanced API** — for creating and using multiple tokens.
  * **Dashboard** — for filtering statistics data by project.

### Add project

To add a new project, follow these steps:

1. In **Navigation**, click **Projects** to open the corresponding pane.
2. In the **Projects** pane, click **+ Add Project**, and go through the steps to configure it:

    * **White list** — here you enter the smart contract address used for project communication. Note that your smart contract have to be deployed either on Ethereum or on other EVM-compatible blockchain.

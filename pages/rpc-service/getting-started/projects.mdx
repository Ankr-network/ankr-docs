# Projects

<Callout type="tip">
**Coming soon**. Available *upon request* for [Premium](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) users only.
</Callout>

*Projects* is a feature that provides the means to use several (up to 5) unique tokens in private endpoints of a single user account. That might help traffic distribution for the most demanding throughput.

In simple words, each new project provides a new unique token to be used either in your private endpoints or for viewing their individual statistics.

**How it works**:

`Request` —> `Provision` —> `Usage`

  * `Request` — ask us if you'd like to use the feature.
  * `Provision` — we do some magic under the hood.
  * `Usage` — start using it in your account.

## Usage

You can use the *Projects* feature working with the following panes:

  * **Endpoints**/**Advanced APIs** — for creating and using multiple tokens.
  * **Dashboard** — for filtering statistics data by project.

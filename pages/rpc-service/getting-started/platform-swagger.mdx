## Introduction

The Web3 API Platform **Swagger UI** offers developers direct, structured access to their Web3 API account through an interactive API documentation interface — bypassing the standard dashboard UI. Built on the [OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html) standard, it provides a familiar experience for those already accustomed to testing and integrating with APIs.

With the Swagger UI, developers and advanced users can automate workflows, integrate Web3 API capabilities into scripts or backend systems, and manage their account with precision and control.

**Key Features**

Through the Swagger interface, you can do the following:

  * **Access Account Data**
    * Retrieve balance, usage stats, referral rewards, and transaction history.
    * View and manage your API keys and JWTs.

  * **Monitor and Optimize Usage**
    * Track blockchain-specific usage across multiple protocols.
    * Analyze interval-based metrics and top consumer stats.

  * **Manage Billing and Payments**
    * Access invoices, Stripe or crypto payment documents.
    * Subscribe, manage, or cancel bundles and recurring payments.

  * **Control Notifications**
    * Configure and manage notification channels (email, Slack, Telegram).
    * Set thresholds for alerts on balance, usage, and credit levels.

  * **Configure Security and Access**
    * Manage 2FA setup and email bindings.
    * Handle enterprise client settings and access controls.

  * **Organize Teams**
    * Create and manage team accounts, invite members, assign roles.

This interface is ideal for users looking to streamline operations, implement custom automation, or integrate Web3 API platform features into CI/CD pipelines and backend services.

## Usage

Before jumping into Swagger UI interaction, you have to go through several preparation steps that include generating an API key for Swagger access, navigating to the Swagger UI, and authorizing your Swagger UI session with the API key generated.

> `API key creation` —> `Swagger UI interaction`

  * [`API key creation`](/rpc-service/getting-started/platform-swagger/#api-key-creation) — your temporary passcode for Swagger interaction.
  * [`Swagger UI interaction`](/rpc-service/getting-started/platform-swagger/#swagger-ui-interaction) — your way around the Swagger UI (navigation, session authorization).

### API key creation

To create an API Key, follow these steps:

1. In **Navigation**, click **Settings > Platform Swagger** to open the corresponding pane.
2. In the **Web3 API Platform Swagger** pane, click **+ Create API key**, enter the basic fields, and then click **Create API key**:

    * **Name**: enter a name for your API key.
<img src="/docs/build/getting-started/enter-name.png" className="responsive-pic" width="400" />
    * **Validity period**: select your key's validity timeframe (**30 days** / **6 months** / **1 year**).

3. In the **Save API key** dialog, copy your API key for further usage.

Congrats — you've just created and copied an API Key for Swagger interaction.

### Swagger UI interaction

**Prerequisites**:

  * [API key creation](/rpc-service/getting-started/platform-swagger/#api-key-creation)

To authorize your Swagger UI session, follow these steps:

1. In the **Web3 API Platform Swagger** pane, click **Platform Swagger UI** to open it in a new tab.
<img src="/docs/build/getting-started/click-swagger-ui.png" className="responsive-pic" width="700" />
2. In the Swagger UI opened, click **Authorize**; in the **Value** field, enter `Bearer`, paste in your copied API key preceded with a space, and then click **Authorize** once again.

# Business Accounts

<Callout type="tip">
Available for [Premium](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) users only.
</Callout>

My Business is a feature that provides the owners with the means to structure and manage their business, and the participants — with the means to perform duties specific to their role in a particular business.

`Business owner`:

  * Creates a business-specific account.
  * Adds required team members to it.
  * Provides team members with access rights to perform their duties.

<Callout type="note">
A business account is a separate account with its individual account balance and dedicated RPC/AAPI endpoints different from those of the mother account. In other words, a business owner can use both their individual and business accounts.
</Callout>

`Business participant`:

  * Switches between multiple business accounts to exercise the roles according to the access rights granted by owners.

## Business owner

Premium plan users can create a single business account to structure and manage their business. That procedure consists of two parts:

  * [Create business account](/rpc-service/getting-started/my-business/#create-business-account)
  * [Invite team members](/rpc-service/getting-started/my-business/#invite-team-members)

### Create business account

1. [Sign in](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in) to the [RPC Service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform.
2. In **Navigation**, click **Settings** to open the corresponding pane.
3. In the **Settings** pane, click the **My Business** tab, and then click **Create business account**.

# Basics with Premium plan

The [Premium service plan](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) enables using the Node API endpoints and Advanced APIs at the corresponding [rate limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#rate-limits). Here is the path to access Premium and start using its functionality:

> `Interface schema` —> `Sign in` —> `Deposit funds` —> `Use private endpoints`

  * [`Interface schema`](/rpc-service/getting-started/intro/#interface-schema): surely, it's always helpful to orient yourself in a new environment. Hardcore users can skip this step and proceed to the following one.

  * [`Sign in`](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in): first things first, the road to using Premium starts with signing in into your account (so we can provide you with the private endpoints and know which account to charge under the [PAYG model](/rpc-service/service-plans/#charging-model-pay-as-you-go) for the requests you make).

  * [`Deposit funds`](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#deposit-funds): second, the positive balance of [API Credits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#how-we-charge) in your account is a must to be able to query the endpoints. That's why you'll have to deposit funds (we support both *Ethereum wallet* and *credit card* payment flows) to be converted into API Credits and stored into your account to make requests. It might be useful to know the [prices](/rpc-service/pricing/) before depositing funds.

  * [`Use private endpoints`](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#use-private-endpoints): finally, after you've signed in and deposited funds into your account, you're all set to start using private Web3 API endpoints.

## Sign in

Web3 API platform supports two authentication options:

<img src="/docs/build/sign-in-method.png" alt="Authentication method" class="responsive-pic" width="500" />

  * [**Google account**](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#via-google-account) — sign in with your Google account. This option provides for the credit card payment flow only, though you can connect your wallet anytime to use the Ethereum wallet payment flow.
  * [**Ethereum wallet**](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#via-ethereum-wallet) — connect your wallet to sign in. This option enables using both Ethereum wallet and credit card payment flows.

### Via Google account

The Google sign in procedure is the following:

1. Go to the [Web3 API](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform.
2. In the top right corner, click **Sign in >** **Continue with Google**, and then select the account to use.

<img src="/docs/build/getting-started/gauth.png" alt="Google authentication" class="responsive-pic" width="400" />

Congrats — you've signed in to Web3 API using your Google account.

### Via Ethereum wallet

<Callout type="warning">
Upon authentication, the system checks whether your Ethereum account has prior transactions.<br/>
Accounts with no transactions can't be used for authentication.
</Callout>

The Ethereum wallet sign in procedure is the following:

1. Go to the [Web3 API](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) platform.
2. In the top right corner, click **Sign in > Continue with ETH Wallet**, select the wallet to use (example: **MetaMask**).

<img src="/docs/build/wallet-select.png" alt="Wallet selection" class="responsive-pic" width="450" />

3. In your wallet, go through required steps:

   * Click **Provide** — to use your public key for token encryption.
   * Click **Sign** — to confirm interactions with our platform.

<img src="/docs/build/card-metamask.png" alt="MetaMask connection" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />

Congrats — you now have an account with Web3 API, associated with your wallet.

## Deposit funds

<Callout>
We’ve pegged the price of our API Credits to USD. It means that upon using ANKR tokens for PAYG, `ANKR` calculates into `API Credits` at the current _ANKR/USD exchange rate on the moment of block's validation_.
</Callout>

Prerequisites:

  * [Sign in via Google account](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#via-google-account)
  * [Sign in via Ethereum wallet](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#via-ethereum-wallet)

The payment process contains the following steps:

1. In **Navigation**, click **Billing** to open the corresponding pane.
2. In the **Payments** box, select the following parameters, and then click **Pay**:
    * **Payment type**:
      * **One-time**: single Pay-as-you-go balance payment.
      * **Recurring**: monthly-repeating Pay-as-you-go balance payment.
      * **Deal**: monthly subscriptions with 20% extra API credits.
       <img src="/docs/build/payments-payment-type.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />
    * **Currency**:
      * **USD**, **ANKR**, **USDT**/**USDC**: all three options available for the **One-time** payment type only.
      * **USD**: the only option for both **Recurring** and **Deal** payment types.
       <img src="/docs/build/payments-currency.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />
    * **Amount**: select the amount in the presets or enter it manually.
       <img src="/docs/build/payments-amount.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />

3. In the **Payment summary** dialog, check whether all the payment parameters selected are valid, and then either proceed to checkout with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or confirm the transaction with your Ethereum wallet.

Congrats — you've just deposited funds into your account balance, and you're all set to use your private endpoints.

## Use private endpoints

Prerequisites:

  * [Sign in](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#sign-in)
  * [Deposit funds](/rpc-service/getting-started/basics-premium/#deposit-funds)

### Premium URL structure

As a Premium user, you have private Endpoints at hand to enable your projects to interact with blockchains.

A Premium URL consists of a connection protocol (`https` or `wss`), domain name (`rpc.ankr.com`), common path of a blockchain to use (`/eth`), and your personal JWT token as the last segment of the path:

```
https://rpc.ankr.com/eth/6fe08843fa0966456eaa3fb19d4828b12389e71f48829f50df25e45bc5fd6cc5
```

### Premium endpoint interaction formula

For a Premium user, the blockchain interaction capabilities still revolve around using Node/Advanced API endpoints but start from a different angle — [Projects](/rpc-service/getting-started/projects/) — which in essence represent individual unique tokens to differentiate and group your private endpoints around a single particular scope of work.

The endpoint for the Premium user can be schematically described by the following formula:

> `Endpoint` = `Project` + `Network`

### Copy endpoint into your app's library

To enable your web3 application to interact with a blockchain, copy the corresponding endpoint into your app's project library or config file:

1. In **Navigation**, click **Projects** to open the pane.
2. In **Projects list**, click the project you'd like to work under.
<img src="/docs/build/endpoints-project.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />

3. In the **Chains** box of the project opened, click the chain you'd like to interact with to expand its contents.
<img src="/docs/build/endpoints-chain.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />

4. In the chain expanded, click the **HTTPS/WSS endpoint** to copy it, and then paste it into your app's working library or config file.
<img src="/docs/build/endpoints-copy.png" class="responsive-pic" width="550" />

Congrats — you've just added a private endpoint into your app's working library or config file to enable blockchain interaction.

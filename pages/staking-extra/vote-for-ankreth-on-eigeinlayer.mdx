# Vote for ankrETH on EigneLayer

Today, you have a chance to support Ankr for the benefit of the staking community and your own.<br/>
We very much appreciate your participation!

EigenLayer has opened a contest for assets to be listed on their decentralized liquid staking protocol.

Ankr proposes to integrate ankrETH with EigenLayer.

This integration will allow ankrETH users to restake this Ankrâ€™s LST within the EigenLayer ecosystem, which would benefit both Ankr's and EigenLayer's communities by increasing total restaked assets on EigenLayer and offering ankrETH users to enhance their rewards thanks to EigenLayer.

To learn more about the proposal, [read it on jokerace.xyz](https://jokerace.xyz/contest/mantle/0x471bb1b5bD70cfF552f82A80797Ea6253Bac94E2/submission/16015294468248193196434960899189864681840019659016808409177046055701322497632).

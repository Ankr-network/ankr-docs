# Get goETH

There are two main options to get goETH (Goerli ETH):
* Requesting it from a faucet.
* Bridging your mainnet ETH to Goerli.

While the first option is free, you can only get a fraction of goETH from a faucet.
The second option, costing you some fees, you can bridge any amount of ETH from mainnet to Goerli.

Here are available faucets and bridges:

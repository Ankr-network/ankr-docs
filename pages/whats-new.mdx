# What's New

## Free APIs via sign in

Effective March 17, to interact with the following chains, you will need to sign in on the Web3 API platform. This change will help us ensure a higher level of security, prevent abuse, and improve the overall quality of service. This measure has been taken to maintain a reliable platform for all users, ensuring fair and secure usage of our API endpoints.

**The list of chains**:

`Aptos`, `Arbitrum`, `Arbitrum Nova`, `Avalanche`, `Base`, `BNB Smart Chain`, `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`, `Gnosis`, `Harmony`, `IoTeX`, `Moonbeam`, `Nervos`, `Solana Devnet`, `Sui`, `Sei`, `TON`, `Optimism`.

**Chains availability on various service plans**:

With the latest updates, we have differentiated API access for different audiences, labeling the corresponding chain groups for quick reference.

  * **Premium Only**: As the label suggests, these chains are available only to Premium users. Sign-in is required to use them, and blockchain interactions are served under the corresponding [Pricing](https://www.ankr.com/docs/rpc-service/pricing/).
  * **Freemium/Premium**: With the chains labeled this way, you can sign in and start interacting with blockchains for free, with limited Freemium functionality. Alternatively, you can always opt in to use superior rate limits and other robust features available for [Premium users](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list).
  * **No label**: These chains can be interacted with immediately by Public users and do not require signing in, as long as your rate limit and feature requirements are within [Public limits](/rpc-service/service-plans/#feature-list). Nevertheless, they can also serve both Freemium and Premium traffic, which will require sign in or corresponding [Premium plan options](https://www.ankr.com/docs/rpc-service/service-plans/#charging-models).

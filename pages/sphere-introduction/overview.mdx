# Overview
Sphere is Ankr's evolved vision of delivering blockchain services, combining the principles of Web2 SAAS model and inspiration of Azure's marketplace with the innovation of the blockchain realm.

Sphere is designed to be flexible and adaptable to cater the needs of various Web3 projects.
Seeing how rollups, particulary zk- and Optimism, have become pivotal in scaling Ethereum and other blockchains, we have decided to offer two base building blocks:
* Rollups as a service
* Sidechains as a service

These two blocks constitute the infrastructural backbone of a successful Web3 project.

For more capabilities we have created through our Developer Marketplace that features a growing collection of plug-and-play modules from Ankr and third-parties. This approach unburdens Web3 developer and companies and lets them get what they want when they want it, saving the costs and time.

## Who needs Sphere?
Many different groups of users may needs Sphere in their development scenarios.

*Businesses* seek scalable, efficient blockchain systems for diversifying offerings and enhancing user experience.


**For ultimate scalability:**

No more competing with other projects for traffic on crowded blockchains — keeping your transactions fast, your fees low, and your users happy. <br /><br />

**For customized control:**
* Configure your own consensus mechanism.
* Choose your own development frameworks and programming languages.
* Determine your very own fine-tuned balance between speed and security.

## Is an AppChain right for me?
AppChains may be the ideal development solution if you:

1. Need help transitioning from Web2 to Web3 and want to own your infrastructure.
2. Want to own your ecosystem without building it from scratch.
3. Have an existing Web3 project looking to onboard your next billion users.
4. Are limited by current L1s and L2s.
5. Have a high-throughput use case needing to process lots of transactions.
6. Have Web3 games that need wallet integration and marketplaces for in-game assets.

## How can I build an AppChain?
Despite all their benefits, AppChains can be difficult to build and launch, which is why Ankr’s expertise and setup service is so crucial for helping users get their AppChains off the ground and into Web3.

There are 6 main technical features that you’ll need to get started with your AppChain:

* [RPC endpoint](/app-chains/components/rpc-endpoints)
* [Validator nodes](/app-chains/components/validator-nodes)
* [Testnet token faucet](/app-chains/components/testnet-faucet)
* [Block explorer](/app-chains/components/block-explorer)
* [Cross-chain bridge](/app-chains/components/relay-hub)
* [Staking UI](/app-chains/components/staking-ui)

And a premium add-on feature you might also be interested in:

* [Advanced APIs](/app-chains/components/advanced-api/overview/)

Through Ankr’s AppChain program, you have several options for each of these components — being able to choose from building certain pieces yourself with our provided instructions and support, or going hands-off and letting us take care of all the technical legwork for you.

You’ll also have access to Ankr’s [Exchange-Readiness program](/app-chains/exchange-readiness-program) in which we use our immense industry experience to help you prepare to apply for token listings on major exchanges.

Solutions like Data Availability Sampling (DAS) and Data Availability Committees (DACs) ensure that all network participants, especially those with limited resources, have assurances that full transaction data has been made available for verification.

  * **ZK-Rollups Interaction with Ethereum**: ZK-rollups operate as off-chain protocols that periodically commit transaction batches to Ethereum's Mainnet. These transactions are recorded on-chain, maintaining immutability and allowing anyone to reconstruct the rollup's state independently. Data availability is crucial for ZK-rollups since it enables permissionless verification of the Layer 2 chain's state and ensures that operations such as user withdrawals are based on accurate and up-to-date information. Ethereum's role is to ensure the availability of data behind every update to the rollup's state, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of transactions executed off-chain.

In essence, Ethereum's structure and consensus mechanisms provide a secure and transparent foundation for rollups by ensuring that data needed to validate transactions is available to all participants, which helps prevent fraudulent activities and enhances the overall security of the network. This system enables Ethereum to support various scaling solutions, including both optimistic and ZK-rollups, by providing a reliable layer for data availability and transaction finality.

## Stake ANKR

<Callout>
Make sure you have some ETH to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

Currently, **ANKR can only be staked on Ethereum**. If you have ANKR on any other chains, please bridge it first to stake it. 

You can claim or restake your rewards after the locking period of 84‚Äì91 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently.
However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.

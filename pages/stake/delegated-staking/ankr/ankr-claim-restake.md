# Claim or restake rewards

## Before you start

<Callout>
Ensure the following:
* You are using a Chrome Browser.
* You have a MetaMask wallet.
</Callout>

## Claim rewards
<Callout>
You can claim or restake your rewards after the locking period of 84–91 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently.

However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.

Rewards accrue on the weekly basis, i.e. you can claim rewards once a week, not daily. 
</Callout>

### Claim all rewards
You may not want to restake your rewards and may want to claim all unlocked rewards at once. To do that:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/).
2. Locate **ANKR** under **Staked tokens** and click **Manage**.
3. On the management page, see the rewards that are past the locking period under **Claimable rewards**. 
4. Click **Claim all**.

### Claim rewards for specific staking transactions
You may want to restake some of your rewards to get higher APY. To do that:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/).
2. Locate **ANKR** under **Staked tokens** and click **Manage**.
3. On the management page, under **Active Staking**, choose a Node Provider and an _unlocked_ stake.
4. Click **Claim** next to the chosen reward.

## Restake rewards

<Callout>
For each of your restaking transactions, you'll be able to claim or, in turn, restake your rewards after the locking period of 84–91 days. This period applies to each restaking transaction independently.

However, your restake will keep generating rewards until you unstake, whether or not the locking period has ended.
</Callout>

You can restake your rewards to increase you APY. To do that:
1. Visit [Ankr Staking Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/dashboard/).
2. Locate **ANKR** under **Staked tokens** and click **Manage**.
3. On the management page, under **Active Staking**, choose a Node Provider and an _unlocked_ reward. 
4. Click **Restake** next to the chosen reward.

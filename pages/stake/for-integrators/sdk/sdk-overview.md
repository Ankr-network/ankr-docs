# Overview

We are ready to provide our services to projects that need infrastructure as a service.

If you want to offer your users a scalable and ready-to-use staking solution, use our SDK to integrate Ankr Staking into your project.

## Difference between API and SDK
Our [API](https://ankr.com/docs/staking/api-overview) and SDK are partially overlapping each other. However, Liquid Staking SDK features more methods than API.

We recommend you use SDK over the API for easier integration and better experience, unless you need something specific that only the API can provide, such as [Ankr Price Oracles](/staking/liquid-staking/oracles/overview). 

## Liquid Crowdloan SDK

[Liquid Crowdloan SDK](/staking/liquid-crowdloan/sdk/) allows you to integrate Parachain Liquid Crowdloan into your project.

Liquid Crowdloan is a very specific and a little outdated functionality. If you don't know what it is, you probably don't need it in your project.

## Liquid Staking SDK

[Liquid Staking SDK](/staking/liquid-staking/sdk) allows you to integrate Ankr Liquid Staking into your project.

## Overview

If you decide to unstake, it can take up to 3-4 days before you can claim your funds. Throughout this period, your MATIC will continue to **earn staking rewards**.

<Callout> 
Before you start, ensure you have ANKR for the unstaking fee (500‚Äì3500 on average) and a small amount of ETH for the dynamic gas fee (approx. 0.0005).

Unstaking MATIC tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the MATIC smart-contracts deployed in Ethereum.

Ankr Staking covers the gas fee cost and charges a small fee in ANKR.

MATIC tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

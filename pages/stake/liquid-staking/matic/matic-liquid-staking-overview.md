# Polygon Liquid Staking

**Polygon Liquid Staking** from Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked MATIC, enabling you to connect your aMATICb/aMATICc tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.

* aMATICb is a reward-earning token, meaning that rewards from MATIC staking will be distributed daily through rebasing and aMATICb holders' balance in their wallet will increase on a daily basis.
* aMATICc is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 aMATICc token vs. MATIC increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.

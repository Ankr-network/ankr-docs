Before you start, ensure you have a small amount of BNB for the gas fee.

Unstaking BNB tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the BNB smart-contracts deployed in Binance chain and BNB Chain.

BNB tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

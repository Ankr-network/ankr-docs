# Unstake ETH

Currently, unstaking is not available, as this functionality is not yet supported by Ethereum.

Unstaking will be enabled after in the [Shanghai upgrade that will follow The Merge in 6-12 months](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#misconceptions). 

Overall, it looks like Shanghai is going to come in ~Q2/Q3 2023.

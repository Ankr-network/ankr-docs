## Overview

If you decide to unstake, it can take up to 4 weeks before you can claim your funds.

<Callout> 
Before you start, you need to have a small AVAX amount to cover the gas fee for the outgoing transactions.

Unstaking AVAX tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the AVAX smart contracts deployed in Avalanche.

Ankr Staking deducts a 2% fee from the staking reward when you unstake.

AVAX tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.

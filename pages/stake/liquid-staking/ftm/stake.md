You can now use your aFTMb reward earning tokens to earn additional layers of rewards on other DeFi platforms listed in [**DeFi**](https://ankr.com/staking/defi/) under the aFTMb section.

2. Find your liquid staking token, click the three-dot menu, and click **Copy token address**.
3. Insert the token address directly into your wallet (e.g. MetaMask).

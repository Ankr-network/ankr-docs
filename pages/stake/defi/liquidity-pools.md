# Liquidity pools
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see dashboard where you can enable the **Liquidity pool** filter. 

This filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit providing liquidity on DEXs and getting a % of the swapping commissions when users swap their tokens using the pool.

Liquidity pairs in the listed liquidity pools usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token. For example, ETH/aETHb or ETH/aETHc.

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a pool:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the pool.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity
To withdraw liquidity from a pool:
1. On the page of the pool, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

## Custom Gas Token

Deploying your AnyTrust Orbit chain or OP Stack chain, you have the option of using a custom gas token, other than ETH, for gas payments on the network. When choosing this option, there are certain requirements that the token needs to comply with.

### AnyTrust Orbit chain

**Requirements**

A custom gas token must meet the following requirements:

  * **ERC-20 Compliance**: The token must conform to the ERC-20 standard.
  * **Native Deployment**: The token must be natively deployed on the parent chain.
  * **Native Bridging and Proper Configuration**: During chain deployment, the gas token must be "natively bridged" and configured as the native gas token on the Orbit chain.

**Custom gas token restrictions for ERC-20**:

  * The token must be configured with 18 decimals.
  * The token can't be rebasing or have a transfer fee.
  * The token must only be transferable via direct calls to the token address.
  * The token must only be able to set allowances via direct calls to the token address.
  * The token must not have a callback on transfer.
  * Users must not be able to make a transfer to themselves that results in a revert.

### OP Stack chain

**Requirements**

The custom gas token must adhere to the following constraints:

  * Must be a valid ERC-20 token.
  * The number of decimals on the token MUST be exactly 18.
  * The name of the token MUST be less than or equal to 32 bytes.
  * Symbol MUST be less than or equal to 32 bytes.
  * Must not be yield-bearing.
  * Cannot be rebasing or have a transfer fee.
  * Must be transferrable only via a call to the token address itself.
  * Must only be able to set allowance via a call to the token address itself.
  * Must not have a callback on transfer, and more generally a user must not be able to make a transfer to themselves revert.
  * A user must not be able to make a transfer have unexpected side effects.

## Arbitrum Bridge Setup

You might be interested in how-tos for the following scenarios:
  * [Add Testnet to Arbitrum bridge](/scaling-services-nocode-deployer/#add-testnet-to-arbitrum-bridge)
  * [Add Mainnet to Arbitrum bridge](/scaling-services-nocode-deployer/#add-mainnet-to-arbitrum-bridge)

### Add Testnet to Arbitrum Bridge

Currently, adding a Testnet Orbit chain to the Arbitrum bridge must be done locally. This means that you will configure the bridge UI to display the desired chain, but this change will only apply to you and be accessible from localhost.

To add a Testnet chain to Arbitrum bridge, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to https://bridge.arbitrum.io/.
  2. Connect to the bridge UI using your Ethereum wallet.
<img src="/docs/scale/connect-wallet.png" className="responsive-pic" width="180" />
  3. In the bridge UI, click your **Wallet address > Settings > Turn on testnet mode** to activate a Testnet mode.
<img src="/docs/scale/dev-mode.png" className="responsive-pic" width="800" />
  4. In **Settings > Add Testnet Orbit Chain**, add a JSON configuration, and then click **Add Chain**. The JSON configuration must contain the following data:
      * A transaction output from bridge deployment
      * Bridge setup data from `OrbitSetupScript.json`

### Add Mainnet to Arbitrum Bridge

To have a Mainnet chain added to the Arbitrum bridge, there are two options available:
  * Request adding a Mainnet chain by filling out the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHusW27KPta53XMD2HAIfgzubQbIxW1ghqOCuXfg-ocWpMeQ/viewform).
  * Fork and host the bridge UI, modifying it to add mainnet chains. The bridge UI can be found on [OffchainLabs' GitHib](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge).

---

## OP Stack: Bridging

The OP Stack is designed to build Layer 2 systems that are deeply integrated with Ethereum. While OP Mainnet handles transaction execution off-chain, developers need the ability to transfer data and tokens between OP Mainnet and Ethereum. This process is known as bridging.

For more information, refer to the [Bridging Basics](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/basics) section in the official Optimism documentation.

# Vaults
Visiting [Ankr DeFi Dashboard](https://www.ankr.com/staking/defi/), you will see a dashboard where you can enable the **Vault** filter. 

The filter allows you to see all the integrated opportunities to make profit, providing liquidity on DEXs and autofarming it via vaults.

Liquidity pairs in the listed vaults usually contain a native token and a corresponding Liquid Staking token.
Rewards can be given either in the tokens deposited to the pool, e.g. ETH/ankrETH, or in the LP token native to the DEX, e.g. CAKE on PancakeSwap. 

### Deposit liquidity
To deposit liquidity into a vault:
1. Click **Deposit** next to the vault.
2. When redirected to the DEX, connect your wallet, choose a vault if there are multiple vaults listed, enter the desired amount of tokens, and deposit them (usually, via the **Deposit** or **Add Liquidity** button).

### Withdraw liquidity and rewards
To withdraw liquidity and/or rewards from a vault:
1. On the page of the vault, click **Withdraw** to get to the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Enter the desired amount of tokens and withdraw them (usually, via the **Withdraw** or **Remove Liquidity** button).

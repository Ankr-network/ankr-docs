# Premium account operations

To start using the _Premium Tier_ services, there are some required steps for you to go through:

`Connect wallet` —>`Top up account balance` —> `Start using custom RPC URLs`

* **[Connect a wallet](/build-blockchain/products/v2/ui-interactions/#connect-wallet)**: first things first, connecting your MetaMask wallet is the key to access your account and start using Premium services.
  
* **[Top up an account balance](/build-blockchain/products/v2/ui-interactions/#top-up)**: surely, you need to have a positive account balance to make any RPC requests. 
  
* **[Start using custom RPC URLs](/build-blockchain/products/v2/ui-interactions-blockchain/#rpc-apis-for-your-project)**: finally, with a wallet connected and a balance topped up, you're all set to start using custom RPC API.

Someday, you might also want to opt for additional actions:

`Withdraw ANKR tokens` or `Add your email`

* **[Withdraw](/build-blockchain/products/v2/ui-interactions/#withdraw)**: get ANKR tokens from your RPC Services account back to your wallet.

* **Add an email address**: this step is optional. You might want to have account status notifications, such as top-ups, withdrawals, and other billing info, sent to your email. You can select the notifications you'd like to receive in **Settings**. Sure, our marketing would love to know our users and be able to propose you some new tailored options from time to time in the future. But, no pressure at all — you can switch those notifications off anytime. And the cherry on top is that for email adding, we're currently depositing _100M bonus API credits_ that you can spend on your Premium requests.

## Connect wallet

The wallet connection procedure is the following:

1. Go to [Ankr RPC service](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/).
2. In the top right corner, click **Connect Wallet** and follow the sequence of self-explanatory steps prompted by your wallet.

Congrats — you now have an account in Ankr RPC Service, associated with your wallet.

## Top up

As always the case, you would need to deposit some tokens into your Ankr account to be able to make RPC requests — that's just the fact of life.

That's where the top-up procedure comes into play:

1. In **Sidebar**, click **Billing** to open the corresponding pane.
2. In the **Top Up Balance** block (top right), enter the amount of ANKR tokens to deposit into your account, and then click **Top Up**.
3. In the **Top Up** dialog, there are three substeps — two of them prompt you for the wallet confirmation:

  * `Confirm top-up operation` — click **Next**.  
  * `Grant ANKRs to contract` — click **Confirm**, and then approve in the wallet.  
  * `Approve spending under contract` — click **Confirm**, and then approve in the wallet.

Congrats — you've added ANKR tokens to your account, and you're all set for using _Premium_ services. 

## Withdraw

Life goes fast, and it might be the case someday that you'd like to get your ANKR tokens back to your wallet. That's exactly what the withdrawal operation has been implemented for.

The withdrawal procedure is the following:

1. In **Sidebar**, click **Billing** to open the corresponding pane.
2. In the **Balance** block (top left), click **Withdraw**.
3. In the **Withdraw** dialog, there are three substeps — one of them prompts you for the wallet confirmation:

  * `Confirm withdrawal operation` — click **Next**.
  * `Withdrawal amount` (min: 500 ANKR) — enter the amount to withdraw, click **Confirm**, and then approve in the wallet.
  * `Transaction validation` — click **Next** and **Done** as soon as the validation completes.

Congrats — you've withdrawn ANKR tokens back to your wallet.

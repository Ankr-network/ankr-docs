# Ankr Advanced APIs

Ankr's Advanced Multichain APIs are the collection of RPC methods created to simplify querying blockchain data. These APIs do all the heavy lifting for developers to query on-chain data in a matter of seconds.

Ankr's *Advanced APIs* is a specifically-tailored collection of JSON-RPC API endpoints built to support the most popular Web3 scenarios on multiple chains at almost instant speeds. We believe it to become a single point of reference for the multi-chain requests.

Query our Advanced APIs at the following URL: `https://rpc.ankr.com/multichain`.

Check out the latest Advanced APIs collections in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19024547/UVsEVUGQ) and look through the Advanced API docs divided into the following sections:

* [NFT APIs](/build/products/advanced-api-sdk/nft-methods/)
* [Query APIs](/build/products/advanced-api-sdk/query-methods/)
* [Token APIs](/build/products/advanced-api-sdk/token-methods/)

## Save Time, Money, and Effort
Ankr’s Advanced APIs take blockchain data and optimize, index, cache, and store it to make it more readily accessible. And, to make things even better, Ankr’s Advanced APIs support all major blockchains so you can search once and get data from six different EVM-compatible blockchains.

Currently, it support six EVM compatible chains: 
- Ethereum
- Fantom
- Binance Smart Chain
- Polygon, Avalanche
- Arbitrum, with more EVM and non-EVM chains coming soon.

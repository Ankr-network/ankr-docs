# BNB Chain

**BNB Chain** is an EVM compatible chain designed to work alongside Binance Chain. 

As well as EVM compatibility, BNB Chain adds smart contract functionality to the chain. The dual-chain architecture alongside Binance Chain enables the sending and receiving of BNB and BEP2 tokens cross-chain.

EVM-compatibility permits support for Ethereum tools and DApps.

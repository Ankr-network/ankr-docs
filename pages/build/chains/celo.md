# Celo

**Celo** is a mobile-first blockchain designed to make decentralized financial (DeFi) tools and services accessible to anyone with a mobile phone.

Celo is a layer 1 protocol and blockchain platform. The Celo Mainnet is entirely separate from the Ethereum network. The Celo client originated as a fork of Ethereum Go language client, [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) (or geth). Celo has several significant differences, including a proof-of-stake based PBFT consensus mechanism. 

All the cryptoassets on Celo have ERC-20 compliant interfaces, meaning that while they are not ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum Mainnet, all familiar tooling and code that support ERC-20 tokens can be easily adapted for Celo assets, including the Celo Native Asset (CELO) and the Celo Dollar (cUSD).

# OP Stack

Optimism Bedrock is the current iteration of the OP Stack. The Bedrock release provides the tools for launching a production-quality Optimistic Rollup blockchain. At this point in time, the APIs for the different layers of the OP Stack are still tightly coupled to this Rollup configuration of the stack.

## OP Stack and Superchain

The OP Stack is the set of software that powers Optimism â€” currently in the form of the software behind Optimism Mainnet and eventually in the form of the Optimism Superchain and its governance.

The OP Stack of today was built to support [the Optimism Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer), a proposed network of L2s that share security, communication layers, and a common development stack (the OP Stack itself). The Bedrock release of the OP Stack makes it easy to spin up an L2 that will be compatible with the Superchain when it launches.

# ZK Stack

The goal of the ZK Stack is to power the internet of value. Value needs to be secured, and only blockchains are able to provide the level of security that the internet needs. The ZK Stack can be used to launch zero-knowledge rollups, which are extra secure blockchains.

ZK Rollups use advanced mathematics called zero-knowledge proofs to show that the execution of the rollup was done correctly. They also send ("roll up") their data to another chain, in our case this is Ethereum. The ZK Stack uses the zkEVM to execute transactions, making it Ethereum compatible.

## ZK stack and Hyperchains

Hyperchains are fractal-like instances of zkEVM running in parallel and with the common settlement on the L1 mainnet. The name Hyperbridge comes from the traditional web, where users can navigate websites using hyperlinks. Similarly, our rollups will be connected with Hyperbridges.

Hyperchains can be developed and permissionlessly deployed by anyone. However, to remain trusted and fully interoperable, each Hyperchain must be powered by the same zkEVM engine available on the ZK Stack (and currently powering the first hyperchain, zkSync Era). All the ZKP circuits will thus remain 100% identical, letting Hyperchains fully inherit their security from L1, no matter who deployed them. This ensures zero additional trust/security assumptions.

Hyperchains will be implemented following the modular approach â€“ using the ZK Stack developers can individually pick different components of their blockchains or implement their own ones (except the zkEVM core, for the reasons explained above).

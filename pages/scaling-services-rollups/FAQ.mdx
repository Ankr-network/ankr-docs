# Rollups as a service

## What are rollups?
Rollups is a scaling solution that functions as secondary layer atop existing blockchains. Unlike sidechains, rollups rely on the backbone of the existing blockchain network, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and so on, and with Ethereum processing an average of 30 TPS, it's clear that scaling solutions are vital.

Rollups allow to process a lot of transaction off-chain, bundle them into a single transaction and commit that transaction on-chain to the mainnet, in periodic intervals. This approach effectively boosts transaction speeds without overloading the blockchain network.

## What is Rollups as a service?
Rollups as a service is a SAAS framework for creating rollups atop different blockchains. Along with [Sidechains as a service](/scaling-services-sidechains/overview/), it is one of the two major building blocks for your Web3 project.

## What blockchains are supported?
Rollups as a service currently support:

* Optimism
* ZkSync
